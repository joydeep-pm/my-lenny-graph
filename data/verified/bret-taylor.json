    "Extract frameworks from advice, not rules - advisors are usually extrapolating from limited experiences, so ask 'why' repeatedly to understand their framework and apply it with nuance to your situation.",
    "Don't wait for AI models to magically work - if you want productivity gains now, create root cause analysis systems to identify what context the models need and build systems to provide it."

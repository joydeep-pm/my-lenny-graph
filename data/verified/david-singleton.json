    "Create tight feedback loops with users by shipping changes within 24 hours - Stripe deploys code to production in 45 minutes to enable rapid iteration",
    "Hire for autonomy and trust generously - at scale, you won't be involved in any decisions that matter, so hire people you trust to make thousands of micro-decisions daily"

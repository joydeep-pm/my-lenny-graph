    "description": "Aishwarya Naresh Reganti and Kiriti Badam have helped build and launch more than 50 enterprise AI products across companies like OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and Databricks. Based on these experiences, they’ve developed a small set of best practices for building and scaling successful AI products. The goal of this conversation is to save you and your team a lot of pain and suffering.\n\n*We discuss:*\n1. Two key ways AI products differ from traditional software, and why that fundamentally changes how they should be built\n2. Common patterns and anti-patterns in companies that build strong AI products versus those that struggle\n3. A framework they developed from real-world experience to iteratively build AI products that create a flywheel of improvement\n4. Why obsessing about customer trust and reliability is an underrated driver of successful AI products\n5. Why evals aren’t a cure-all, and the most common misconceptions people have about them\n6. The skills that matter most for builders in the AI era\n\n*Get 15% off Aishwarya and Kiriti’s Maven course, Building Agentic AI Applications with a Problem-First Approach, using this link:* https://bit.ly/3V5XJFp\n\n*Brought to you by:*\nMerge—The fastest way to ship 220+ integrations: https://merge.dev/lenny\nStrella—The AI-powered customer research platform: https://strella.io/lenny\nBrex—The banking solution for startups: https://www.brex.com/product/business-account?ref_code=bmk_dp_brand1H25_ln_new_fs\n\n*Episode transcript:* https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/what-openai-and-google-engineers-learned\n*Archive of all Lenny's Podcast transcripts:* https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/yxi4s2w998p1gvtpu4193/AMdNPR8AOw0lMklwtnC0TrQ?rlkey=j06x0nipoti519e0xgm23zsn9&st=4jmgl11w&dl=0\n\n*My biggest takeaways (for paid newsletter subscribers):* https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/i/183007822/referenced\n\n*Where to find Aishwarya Naresh Reganti:*\n• LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/areganti\n• GitHub: https://github.com/aishwaryanr/awesome-generative-ai-guide\n• X: https://x.com/aish_reganti\n\n*Where to find Kiriti Badam:*\n• LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-kiriti-badam\n• X: https://x.com/kiritibadam\n\n*Where to find Lenny:*\n• Newsletter: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com\n• X: https://twitter.com/lennysan\n• LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky/\n\n*In this episode, we cover:*\n(00:00) Introduction to Aishwarya and Kiriti\n(05:03) Challenges in AI product development\n(07:36) Key differences between AI and traditional software\n(13:19) Building AI products: start small and scale\n(15:23) The importance of human control in AI systems\n(22:38) Avoiding prompt injection and jailbreaking\n(25:18) Patterns for successful AI product development\n(33:20) The debate on evals and production monitoring\n(41:27) Codex team’s approach to evals and customer feedback\n(45:41) Continuous calibration, continuous development (CC/CD) framework\n(58:07) Emerging patterns and calibration\n(01:01:24) Overhyped and under-hyped AI concepts\n(01:05:17) The future of AI\n(01:08:41) Skills and best practices for building AI products\n(01:14:04) Lightning round and final thoughts\n\n*Referenced:*\n• LevelUp Labs: https://levelup-labs.ai/\n• Why your AI product needs a different development lifecycle: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/why-your-ai-product-needs-a-different\n• Booking.com: https://www.booking.com\n• Research paper on agents in production (by Matei Zaharia’s lab): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04123\n• Matei Zaharia’s research on Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I1EvjZsAAAAJ&hl=en\n• The coming AI security crisis (and what to do about it) | Sander Schulhoff: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-coming-ai-security-crisis\n• Gajen Kandiah on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gajenkandiah\n• Rackspace: https://www.rackspace.com\n• The AI-native startup: 5 products, 7-figure revenue, 100% AI-written code | Dan Shipper (co-founder/CEO of Every): https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/inside-every-dan-shipper\n• Semantic Diffusion: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html\n• LMArena: https://lmarena.ai\n• Artificial Analysis: https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/providers\n• Why humans are AI’s biggest bottleneck (and what’s coming in 2026) | Alexander Embiricos (OpenAI Codex Product Lead): https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/why-humans-are-ais-biggest-bottleneck\n• Airline held liable for its chatbot giving passenger bad advice—what this means for travellers: https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240222-air-canada-chatbot-misinformation-what-travellers-should-know\n• Demis Hassabis on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/demishassabis\n...References continued at: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/what-openai-and-google-engineers-learned\n\n_Production and marketing by https://penname.co/._\n_For inquiries about sponsoring the podcast, email podcast@lennyrachitsky.com._\n\nLenny may be an investor in the companies discussed.",

It's probably a lot harder to build that and it just doesn't work. And then they're just like, \"Okay, this is a failure. What are we even doing?\"",

        "text": "Yes. And again, I want to make sure that we drive home the right point. There are tons of similarities of building AI systems and software systems as well, but then there are some things that kind of fundamentally change the way you build software systems versus AI systems. And one of them that most people tend to ignore is the non-determinism. You're pretty much working with a non-deterministic API as compared to traditional software. What does that mean and why does that have to affect us is in traditional software, you pretty much have a very well-mapped decision engine or workflow. Think of something like Booking.com. You have an intention that you want to make a booking in San Francisco for two nights, et cetera. The product has kind of been built so that your intention can be converted into a particular action and you kind of are clicking through a bunch of buttons, options, forms, and all of that, and you finally achieve your intention."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "But now that layer in AI products has completely been replaced by a very fluid interface, which is mostly natural language, which means the user can literally come up with a ton of ways of saying or communicating their intentions. And that kind of changes a lot of things because now you don't know how your user's going to be here. That's on the input side. And the output is also that you're working with a non-deterministic probabilistic API, which is your LLM. And LLMs are pretty sensitive to prompt phrasings and they're pretty much black boxes. So you don't even know how the output surface will look like. So you don't know how the user might behave with your product, and you also don't know how the LLM might respond to that. So you're now working with an input, output, and a process. You don't understand all the three very well. You're trying to anticipate behavior and build for it.",
        "timestamp": "00:09:53",
        "text": "And with agentic systems, this kind of gets even harder. And that's where we talk about the second difference, which is the agency control trade-off. What we mean by that, and I'm kind of shocked so many people don't talk about this. They're extremely obsessed with building autonomous systems, agents that can do work for you. But every time you hand over decision-making capabilities or autonomy to agentic systems, you're kind of relinquishing some amount of control on your end. And when you do that, you want to make sure that your agent has gained your trust or it is reliable enough that you can allow it to make decisions. And that's where we talk about this agency controlled trade-off, which is if you give your AI agent or your AI system, whatever it is, more agency, which is the ability to make decisions, you're also losing some control and you want to make sure that the agent or the AI system has earned that ability or has built up trust over time."

      {
        "speaker": "Lenny Rachitsky",
        "timestamp": "00:10:49",
        "text": "So just to summarize what you're sharing here, essentially, people have been building product, software products for a long time. We're now in a world where the software you're building is one, non-deterministic, can just do things differently. As you said, you go to booking.com, you find a hotel, it's going to be the same experience every time. You'll see different hotels, but it's a predictable experience. With AI, you can't predict that it's going to be the exact same thing, the thing that you plan it to be every time. And then the other is there's this trade-off between agency and control. How much will the AI do for you versus how much should the person still be in charge? And what I'm hearing is the big point here is this significantly changes the way you should be building product. And we're going to talk about the impact on how the product development lifecycle should change as a result."

        "speaker": "Kiriti Badam",
        "timestamp": "00:11:39",
        "text": "Yeah, it's definitely one of the key points that this kind of distinction needs to exist in your mind when you're starting to build. For example, think about if your objective is to hike Half Dome in Yosemite. You don't start hiking it every day, but you start training yourself in minor parts and then you slowly improve and then you go to the end goal. I feel like that's extremely similar to what you want to build AI products in the sense that when you don't start with agents with all the tools and all the context that you have in the company in day one and expect it to work or even tinker at that level. You need to be deliberately starting in places where there is minimal impact and more human control so that you have a good grip of what are the current capabilities and what can I do with them and then slowly lean into the more agency and lesser control."

Because I really think that basically what I tell people is I've made every single mistake in the book. And then I got to the end of the book and I started inventing new mistakes. So mostly what I feel is that I like sharing my stories because I want to help people. I want to help people not make the same mistakes I did. And I also want to help people make sense of what they're experiencing. But I started in tech in 2007. I actually started at Google the week the iPhone launched and a lot of my scaling battle scars come from a couple of experiences. They come from a year and a half at Google, which is not very long."

But my department, which was the communications department, was 25 people when I joined and it grew in nine months to 125 people. And that was really my first experience with just all the sort of things that I still talk about today. In terms of what it feels like to grow really, really fast and sort of all the tools that I started developing from there. After Google, I left and followed Cheryl Sandberg and Elliot Schrage to Facebook. And I spent five years at Facebook. And I joined Facebook in 2008, and it's important context because it was 80 million users at the time. We were smaller than MySpace. It was 270 million in revenue, 500 employees. It did not feel inevitable. Most people thought we were going to sell it to Microsoft. When I told people I was going there, they were like, isn't that place just like a site for college kids? And so I was there for five years and it was a crazy five years.",

        "text": "When I left, it was 5,500 employees, five billion in revenue, over a billion users. So a huge amount of what I experienced, what I write about, what I talk about in Glue Club, which is the community that I run, comes from that rapid scale at Google and Facebook. But I also, I left Facebook right after we went public, about six months after we went public. And I only like doing jobs that I'm highly unqualified for. I like being on learning curves so steep that I'm scared I'm going to fall off. And so I left and I wanted to learn what it took to build something from nothing. And so I joined this little startup founded by Brett Taylor, a startup called Quip. I joined a couple of months before we launched and ran everything that wasn't product and engineering there for him. And that was such a valuable experience to me because the experience of building something from nothing is actually quite different than the experience of holding on for dear life while things are scaling so fast around you."

If you look historically, we've had a bunch of technology shifts from the internet to the cloud to mobile to social, all of these different types of things. Some of them come with new distribution platforms, new ways to distribute products, and some of them don't, but the most powerful ones, the most impactful ones are the ones that do come with these new distribution platforms.

It seems quaint now. Then I did a decent job and so my boss, Marissa Meyer, gave me the opportunity to lead a new product initiative, which was a big bet on me and it was both an opportunity to do something for Google, but I was also being pretty scrutinized just as a young new product manager and the premise given to me was work on local search."

Actually, it was an important enough initiative that actually, there was on the Google homepage, it had Web, Images and Local was up there as well, so it's got top bill."

I have other more well-reasoned takes to give you, but this is my hottest one, which is I think that AI may be one of the biggest force for reshoring American jobs. And so I think everyone is worried about it unemploying people. And for sure, it will change the skills needed to do the jobs that you're doing, but I think it may actually reshore a lot of jobs, and it'll do that in two ways."

And what cheap intelligence does is it makes those kinds of things affordable for small companies and individuals. So it stimulates demand. The other thing that it does is it allows people who are in those jobs to serve more people cheaply. It may not get rid of customer service, for example, but it may allow 10 people in the Midwest, who would normally be working at a call center, to serve hundreds of thousands or millions of people. Maybe that's too much, but a lot more people than they would ordinarily if they were the ones on the phone all the time.",
        "timestamp": "00:06:22",
        "text": "And so it becomes much more cost-effective for American companies to hire people in the US. And I think the people in the US are going to be better, in a lot of cases, at using these AI tools to do work. So I think it may actually make it more effective to have those jobs in the US run by people sitting in the US who are using it to get work done. And also, the model companies are here too. So there's a lot of American stuff happening, and you can decide whether or not you think that's a good thing, but I think it's quite lost in the conversation over whether AI will get rid of jobs."

I think people are truly sleeping on how good Claude Code is for non-coders. And I'll extend this to not just Claude Code, but Google just came out with the Gemini CLI command-line interface. So things like that. And I'll tell you for people who are listening that don't know what Claude Code is. Claude Code is just the command-line interface. It's those black terminals that programmers use. It's a command-line interface that you can boot up. It has access to your file system, it knows how to use any kind of terminal command and it knows how to browse the web, all that kind of stuff."

Especially with Claude Opus 4 that just came out, it's this gigantic leap forward in AI's ability to work by itself. And Claude Code can even spawn multiple sub-agents that do a bunch of tasks in parallel and it's incredibly useful for programmers. Everybody inside of Every is using it all day, every day. Everyone's agent-pilled. They've got 15 agents doing all this kind of stuff. It's crazy.",

And so I think Hiroki gave himself time to do that and I think that's probably a lot of why he's been so successful at Airbnb. The thing I took away from Apple, and I think this is true for anybody changing from one major culture to another is most likely the new place hires you because of the values of the organization you left, but not the behaviors."

When you hear somebody's story and it seems irrational, like we'll have people go, \"Oh my God, that's an anomaly. That doesn't happen.\" But what you realize is that the context makes the irrational rational. So the moment you hear a story, you go, \"I can't believe that,\" nine times out of 10, it's because you don't have the rest of the story. And so part of it's being able to understand the rest of that context that would drive somebody to say, \"Why would somebody cut their arm off?\" Well, if they're in this situation and this and this and this, there's nobody who would say they want to cut their arm off, but in certain situations you'll do it.

        "text": "This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your journey."

        "speaker": "And so Jobs to Be Done is this whole premise that people hire products, they don't buy them, they hire them to make progress in their life. And if we can take a step back and look at it, we see it in a very different light to realize at some point they're in some context and there's some outcome they want. And if we can understand that, we start to realize that different things compete, right?",
        "timestamp": "00:05:51",
        "text": "A simple example is think of Snickers and Milky Way, right? They're both candy bars, they're both bought in the checkout aisle, they're both made almost with the same ingredients, one has peanuts, one doesn't. And if you start to compare the products and do a competitive benchmark, you start to get to one's a little softer, one's a little harder, one's got a few more calories, one's got less calories. But when you talk to people about when's the last time they ate a Snickers, when time's the last time they ate a Milky Way, you start to realize that Snickers typically is a case where they missed the last meal, they've got a lot of work to do, they're running out of energy and they want to basically get back to the tasks as fast as possible. And so you start to realize that Snickers is about almost like a meal replacement and it's about the stomach is growling and things like that. And you start to realize that if they didn't have a Snickers, it competes with a protein drink, it competes with a Red Bull, a coffee."

        "text": "To maybe follow up on this example a bit, how often do you find these jobs emerge after they've developed a product, in this case I guess Snickers or Milky Way, how often is it just like they see this problem and actually apply this approach even accidentally?"

        "text": "What's interesting is that at least for me, the thing is what I learned was that supply and demand are not as connected as everybody thinks. Most people think they create a product and that creates demand. But the real thing that if you start to study causality is that a struggling moment causes demand. And you start to realize that in some cases that struggling moment exists and can exist for a long time and nobody solved it. So one of the companies I helped was Southern New Hampshire University and Paul Le Blanc. And one of the things in 2010, we found basically these anomalies, these people who were going to school but not actually coming to class and watching everything online. And it was like 50 or 60 of them and the anomalies basically, and they're paying full price, they didn't want to come. For Paul, it was kind of like why are they doing this?"

It had the sort of home experience where everything was incredibly personalized for the individuals, and there were several motivational elements built into the whole product experience.

And it was almost as if there was a strategy gene that you needed to be born with to be good at it. And that bothered me a lot, and I sort of wanted to ask myself, is it possible to break that divide between the haves and the have-nots and make this capability widely accessible through a procedural approach.

So product strategy, strategy sits between the mission and vision and the plan. It could be at the company level or at the team level, but it's usually sitting between the mission and vision and the plan. And the plan, you can call the plan the roadmap, which is basically an ordered list of things that you want to get done and the mission and vision is basically sort of the purpose of existence, what does it look like when you achieve your purpose of existence? So it sits between the two and it forces choice to deploy scarce resources to generate maximum impact."

Amjad is the co-founder of Replit, an AI-powered software development and deployment platform for building and shipping software.

There's a lot of talk these days about how AI is changing, how products will be built, how product teams are going to operate, which functions will be more and less valuable over time. But I feel like very few people have actually seen what modern AI tools can do and have fully grasped how much you can get done with very little technical skill now and in the future. And so I'm going to do an experiment with this podcast where I'm going to do a series of behind the product episodes where we go deep on important products that product builders should be aware of and should probably start playing with."

And the best part of it is someone in the... replied to him and they're like, \"You have to launch an app. You have to host it somewhere. You have to build a database. You have to deploy it.

So Cursor is a fork of VS Code that's made that has really awesome AI tools, but that's an editor. You still need runtime, you still need a deployment environment.

My one mindset that I really have leaned into after someone actually gave me advice on this is to figure out how to have fun in my job, even in the most difficult of times. The reason why I say that is because when you're hit with really hard times, it's easy to operate from a mindset of scarcity and to look at everything as an unachievable hurdle to overcome. And when I was able to switch my mindset and say, \"Well, I'm actually going to figure out a way to have fun with this,\" it actually changed my entire for how to deal with super difficult situations."

So in this case, you shared an example of basically you have to fire a bunch of people, not something one can quickly think about how to have fun with that. How did you do this? Is it just in your mind you're like, \"I'm going to have fun with this,\" or is there something tactically people can do to make something fun?"

What can I get out of this that's a positive outcome even though it is incredibly challenging to be facing it right now? So that's one thing that I've done. The second thing I think that has been really helpful is in going into meetings or other situations where I was trying to figure out how to collectively solve some big challenge, figuring out how to bring humor into the meeting. Just starting it on a light note and that elevated my own mood and way I was approaching the meeting, but also adds a level of levity to the situation for other people as well, which I think as a leader is super important because it's not just about your own mindset, but how are you transferring that mindset to the people that you're working with and the people that are working for you."

What I look for instead are things that can be gardened, things that can grow on their own and that you can direct or maybe give a little bit of extra energy to or curate over, and is a totally different mindset for it. If you do this properly, it looks like magic. I've been told that this is completely against all the advice that people get, including products nowadays, but I think it's a very powerful approach that works in a lot of different contexts."

A lot of your Bits and Bobs have been just like, \"Here's what's happening. Holy shit.

But my take is I'm a huge believer in market forces and empowerment, so provide guardrails for what a good experience is in your marketplace, set a clear bar for quality, and provide the right coaching and tools for supply to be successful, and then take a step back and see where the gaps are and invest more in hands-on tactics just to close those gaps more specifically."

I think I've been building and scaling marketplaces for I think almost 15 years now, and I feel like they add just such a fascinating dimension to the challenge that we work on as PMs, and it's this hidden dimension that you uncover when you work on marketplaces. And I think on paper what makes a marketplace is pretty straightforward, it's two or more sides that are distinct from one another, and they provide value to each other, and then you have an intermediary trying to facilitate that exchange of value in the middle. So, that's pretty simple explanation. I think in practice it's always a little bit more nuanced on the fringes. You have all those interesting dimensions, like how involved is the intermediary defines how managed the marketplace is. So, something like Craigslist is super hands-off, unmanaged, and something like Lyft starts to be more into the semi-managed where the platform significantly shapes the transaction in this exchange of value. So, I think that's how I see it, but there's all those fascinating variations of marketplaces, I guess."

They want to be the ones that come up with every single sort of product idea and every single detail.

If you're an engineering leader or on a platform team, at some point your CEO will inevitably ask you for productivity metrics, but measuring engineering organizations is hard and we can all agree that simple metrics like the number of PRs or commits doesn't tell the full story. That's where DX comes in. DX is an engineering intelligence solution designed by leading researchers, including those behind the DORA and SPACE frameworks. It combines quantitative data from developer tools with qualitative feedback from developers to give you a complete view of engineering productivity and the factors affecting it."

Check out this new feature, and these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone.",

I think it's really rare that people, one, see a company scale to the heights of Uber and Opendoor with such a heavy operational component that are still tech companies and also it's really where someone starts an ops and then moves into product and ends up where you are, where your chief product officer, really successful company. So I have a bunch of questions here. Maybe the first is just what has having been in ops done to make you a better product leader? How does that change the way that you operate as a product leader?"

I felt like I was kind of stuck. I felt like I was working harder but not seeing incremental benefit to the work that I was doing. And I knew that I needed a change, but emotionally I understood that, but I couldn't really have an objective way of thinking about it. And so I really pushed myself to figure out what is actually going on with my situation and how do I create a way that I can rely on objectively to understand what's actually going on? And so I looked at that situation and I wrote that post and the framework is really that there's impact that you're really trying to drive and that is the thing that is the most important. And the impact is only achievable by looking at two sets of variables, a set of variables related to the environment, a set of variables related to your skills, and really breaking down each and understanding what's happening in the environment bit by bit and what's happening with your skills and where are you hindered structurally within the environment? Where are your skills kind of lacking and what do you have control over? And using that whole kind of output, that framework to decide what makes the most sense."

That is actually a form of impact. Just creating the clarity that people need to understand and believe in the investment. The reason why I name this and it feels a little counterintuitive is that the more senior you get, the more there are questions of are we even investing in the right place, right? Is this area, is this team, is this org the right investment? And so being able to even create the clarity that there is opportunity, it is the right thing to do, it is strategically and structurally important, is a form of impact. And then actually delivering on that impact, showing that you can make progress quickly, that you can deliver fast lane wins as Casey Winters would say, or medium and slow wins and then actually showing that you can do this again and again is how you actually validate the impact that you can see where the opportunity is and what's going on."

Environment in this case, I think I kind of discreetly named a few things. One is your manager, then there's the resources. So what kind of team do you have? Is your team staffed appropriately? Do you have the right P&L, whatever budget to get the things done that you need? Then there's a scope, what is in your remit versus not in your remit? Because if you don't have enough scope, then you can't actually focus on the things that are most important. The team itself, the skills, relative skills of the team, your compensation in some ways is part of the environment because if you're not compensated fairly, you don't believe you are, then it's hard to feel like the work that you're doing is meaningful."

She's won over $4 million in tournaments, including winning a World Series of Poker Bracelet, and she's the only woman who's won the World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions and the National Poker Heads-Up Championship. Currently, she spends her time helping companies make better decisions. In our conversation, we cover the many lessons that she's learned from her friend Daniel Kahneman, who recently passed away. What simple change she's found has the most impact in a company's ability to make better decisions, how to make better quick decisions when the feedback loop is very long, and also why she doesn't actually believe in long feedback loops, how she changed the way that the partners at First Round Capital make decisions, which is incredibly interesting."

But the thing about Danny was when you talked about it, he was the first one to tell you, \"I wish priming wasn't in the book.

So one of his favorite things, and he in some ways invented it, was find someone who really disagrees with you and then write a paper with them and try to figure out with them what's the study that would resolve the issue. So an example of that was Danny did work on happiness as it relates to wealth. Kahneman and a collaborator, Angus Deaton, they published a result that got a lot of press about the relationship between money and happiness, and the idea was money doesn't buy happiness beyond $75,000. So that got published in 2010. I'm sure if you ran that exact same study, it would be more than $75,000 now because it would adjust for inflation. But it was like the idea being once your basic needs are met and you're not that worried about paying rent and so on and so forth, it's not going to have that big of an effect."

And instead, it was Kahneman's like, \"All right, let's do it together.\" And they joined forces along with Barb Mellers to basically try to resolve that issue. He was just always seeking out, it was just like everything was like, why am I wrong? And he was eager and he was excited and he wanted to...",

And I think that in the end, it's hard to believe, but I just think that that dwarfs his body of work, which is spectacular. But he as a human being was just so spectacular.

        "text": "They use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions, and they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan.

If you have none, it's unlikely you're going to experience quite as rich and full a life. So I often talk about relationships exist on a continuum. At one end of the continuum is contact and no connection, or we could also say dysfunction. And by the way, contact no connection. Those are thousands of Facebook friends. Those are not relationships and those are not friends in my vocabulary. At the other end of the continuum is what my co-author David Bradford and I came to call exceptional, and exceptional relationships have a particular set of characteristics that I can get into if you want to. But before I even do that, we're not suggesting, and I'm not suggesting that everybody needs to turn every one of their relationships into something exceptional."

And likewise in the class, the lectures are scaffolding on which you can hang your experience. But most of the learning happens in these small groups called T groups. The T stands for training, not therapy. And sometimes people think they sound like therapy, and they sometimes even experience them as feeling a little bit like therapy, but that's not what they are. We call them training groups. And what happens in that group is that there's 12 participants and two facilitators, and they are, for example, given a task, I might pair two students up and say, okay, you've got 10 minutes."

Prior to Y Combinator, Dalton was the co-founder and CEO of imeem, which was acquired by Myspace, and Co-founder and CEO of App.net, which was an early ads-free competitor to Twitter. Dalton has seen and worked with more startups than nearly any human alive and in our conversation we get incredibly tactical and deep on the startup journey. Why it all comes down to simply not losing hope and not letting your startup die. What to do when your startup is struggling and how to know when it is time to give up.

So we all understand talent. It's like if someone has a talent for music, someone has a talent for athletics, whatever it happens to be. And that's true. That exists, but the way I think about it is talent basically controls the slope of the curve, but most things are actually acquirable skills.

Okay, skill number one, you have to be able to stand up on stage and not pass out.\" That's kind the bare minimum. And so what I did over the years is to say, \"Okay, I'm going to functionally decompose this skill of public speaking in front of,\" what I call high-stakes speaking. I've got to actually hold the audience's attention. That's part of success. So it doesn't matter what the message is, nothing else will matter if I lose their attention, which is increasingly easy to do now in kind of short attention span society."

It's like, okay, well there's humor writing, there's humor, execution on stage, whatever. There's standup comedy. There's like, okay, so how do you put all these pieces together? And along that journey, I came up with this... and I've always had this, I'm a very data-driven, quant based person. It's like, \"Okay, well, how will I know whether something is actually funny enough or not, whether I'm losing the attention or not?\" And so in preparation for one of these high stakes keynotes that I do every year, I will have my talk, I will do practice runs.",

I will have the talks transcribed. I have custom software that I've written that will say, \"Okay, here are the points at which the audience laughed.\" Actually audibly laughed. That's the only way it counts. And this actually... and it comes down to this metric that standup comedians use called LPM laughs per minute. And there's actually a benchmark that you can say, \"Oh, well...\" And standup comedians have a very, very high LPM. Business talks have a very, very low LPM. The most popular Ted talks there's a high strong correlation between the most popular Ted talks and high. So I have a goal, look, I'm going to have a minimum I want to improve.

A better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and roadmapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian. With Jira Product Discovery, you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets. Create and share custom product roadmaps with any stakeholder in seconds. And it's all built on Jira, where your engineering team's already working. So true collaboration is finally possible. Great products are built by great teams, not just engineers."

When I look at product management in India, and I do have a lot of friends comparing product management versus in US or even in Europe versus even in China, Southeast Asia, et cetera. I think India has had a very interesting journey of products in general and hence, product management also. I think till about 2010-ish, there were not really many products built for the Indian consumers in the first place. There were a lot of products being built, a lot of technology being built, but largely, because it was a back office, so you had a lot of great engineers working in companies which would build products for the American customer or even for the European customer and so on. So once these startups started coming in, which were thinking about building for the Indian consumers, I think we did not really have that talent which we could directly tap into. We're trained into product building. Forget product management as a field in the first place. There were no colleges which were teaching anything about this. There was no playbooks, and so on, and so forth. We would go to the internet, and look at YouTube, and look at SVPG and all of that, but what we would understand would not... you could not put directly to the Indian startups."

India has what? 1.4 billion people. So there were three waves, really, that happened in India, but also, in the globe. I think first wave was from desktop to mobile, and then even from mobile to smartphones. From smartphones, there was what we call the Jio revolution. There's an Indian company called Reliance Jio that basically got internet at the cheapest prices for smartphones. So because of this, a whole population came onto the internet which was hungry for newer products, newer content, completely different ways of interacting with each other, and using internet for all sorts of different things. That was one of the waves."

So even if you do not have a bank account or that bank account is linked to your mobile phone number, but now everybody would pay through that, and that brought in a very different kind of revolution. So even if 5 rupees, that is basically 10 cents or less than that, that would be paid through UPI, and people started moving away from cash and so on. There's something called the India Stack that is all of these things coming together, which is social security, identity, payments, and so on, that a whole bunch of other apps can now use to build their own layers on top of that. So many interesting cases started coming about. So that's one which is just a number and the infrastructure.",

There's an elders' quote in India like, \"Every 15 miles, the language will change, and the people and the culture will change, and it's a huge country of so many people.\" So your traditional ways of thinking about products also, the \"Who I'm building for?\" is very different. \"Are you building for this person or that?\" Et cetera. So a bunch of frameworks break down because it's not even that the same language will apply. While English is a language that is used by the people at least who have the money and who have the dollar to even give to you, but you have to think way more widely."

They find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. That's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity. And what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And so I basically got involved in every single detail and I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement. I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product."

Also, how the product team now operates including having just one single roadmap across the entire company and Brian staying very close to every design and every feature.

One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors. A trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact."

But as he would describe it, good decisions are made by first understanding all the different points of view and pros and cons to the potential issue at hand or the potential direction, and that great leaders, what they do is they solicit these different points of views. They have a team that they work with to debate and discuss things. So another way to think about this, a king and their court. In an ideal world, if you assume that there's no political motivations, the court is there to advise the king and help them think through different problems and provide different and opposing points of view to allow the king to arrive at the right decision.",

So, obviously the idea of working backwards, the idea of one way and two way door decisions, the concept of disagreeing and committing input and output metrics using memos versus decks, just the idea of two pizza teams, and then I know that evolved into single-threaded leaders.

For most of these, there were other inspirations or we built on work that others had done, which by the way, was what I think all great companies should do.

We actually branched out beyond just a retail business, we had a third party marketplace business. We were experimenting in those days with providing running websites for third party retailers in those days too. We were developing new things. We were in many countries around the world. So, we'd become very complex. And what happens to that point is that then you reach this point where the CEO can no longer be in every important meeting, can no longer be involved with hiring every person. And you need a system, a method to run the company effectively. And Jeff Bezos is fundamentally, he's a very scientific and analytical thinker."

She led their original launch and go-to-market and also their branding and positioning and messaging work.

You were the 10th employee at Figma, which is now worth tens of billions of dollars depending on which valuation you look at, and probably thousands of employees. I don't even know, but many, many. And you joined before the product even launched. And so, I have a million questions I want to ask about how Figma grew and all the things that went into it. I'm curious what it was like to be early days at Figma. Is there a memory that comes to mind that's zany, funny, fun, tangible of just what it was like to work at Figma in the early days?"

I'd been in another startup before that, I launched stuff, but I was still kind of junior. I had done these things, but I didn't have a ton of cycles, and I never ran the whole thing from like, okay, messaging and positioning. This was a forcing function for us to do our messaging and positioning. And I remember there was more than one day where we locked ourselves in a conference room and I made Dylan and show at the time have this positioning up on the big screen and made them agree on it word for word. We'd just never done that before. But then I'd also never run PR press and all of a sudden, I had to run press and PR."

I remember Greylock was helpful at least over there, but ultimately, they help a lot, but they don't know your business as intimately as you do. So at the end of the day, that's something Dylan's really good at is trusting his intuition and gut. And so, he was helpful on the decision making, but then also you just got to go for it. And I think that that's something that I learned at that time that's helped me throughout the rest of my career is building that confidence or that trust in yourself because it wasn't something that I necessarily immediately had."

You can't do that anymore. So, what that means is these ad networks are becoming more complex, sophisticated, and interesting, right at the same time that it's harder for marketers to really understand how they're spending money. And so I am paying a lot of attention to how marketers make decisions with probabilistic data because most of the work that I'm doing now is actually saying, well, given that we don't have determinist data about a per certain audience or where somebody came from, how can I find other information that will create a model for 30% of the population and we can use that to extrapolate to a hundred."

Because marketing technology is like this very amorphous, cross-functional discipline that lives at the crossroads of product and growth and engineering and marketing. It brings together processes and systems from a wide range of disciplines. And I think really the way to think about marketing technology is it's a product manager whose specific role and focus is the system or the third party or first party platform because marketing technology can mean a collection of third party tools, which is a lot of people think, but as a company scales and grows actually it could include a collection of first party homegrown solutions that you build yourself with or in addition to third party. So, I like to think about marketing technology more as one piece is people and process and the other is the system and the platform. And that probably sounds pretty familiar to what a lot of product people think about their world as, and that's how I define MarTech."

There's a lot of startups I would say are 30 people or less where you have a growth team and your growth acquisition person is using a CDP to send data to their ad network to run their ads because that's part of their job and maybe they are the MarTech person. And actually you find a lot of people who consider themselves MarTech professionals now having started in growth or user acquisition roles because they had to just use tools in order to get their jobs done. But what I would say is as a company grows and scales, it moves from being a community or village driven aspect of your products to being something that's centrally owned. If you're a startup, again, like 30 to 40 people, everybody might chip in to manage your CDP or use Amplitude or build a first party solution on top of those."

        "speaker": "It's a mixture of first and third party tools and engineering and product and marketing all work together on it. That doesn't scale though. As you cross a hundred to 200 people, somebody has to be responsible for knowing how data flows through tools, how it's worked, what's the schema. And that's not even considering procurement and legal stuff. You have infinite liability if you don't manage your contracts well. And so usually around I would call it a hundred to 150 people is the critical mass where you can't just have a village approach to systems and tools much like in the IT org, if it was a village approach to SSO businesses would be in a lot of danger. That's where you typically start to see the question of, all right, we need a systems and tools person. We need somebody to manage these systems and manage that platform.",
        "timestamp": "00:08:01",
        "text": "And there's a variety of ways it can go. I've seen it go just into pure product that's with a product operations org and a product ops person actually will manage a lot of third and first party tools. I've seen it go into the IT org, Walmart for example, at a really big scale. They had a MarProd function which was marketing products. It was product within the marketing function or product that was designed to serve marketing. And then of course you can have more traditional routes like you can have marketing technology as a single standalone unit or business technology as a standalone unit. Some of this depends too on whether the business is B2C versus B2B. Classically in a B2B business you see it in rev ops or some types of systems role because you have to serve not only users coming into your funnel, but then the businesses that you're serving afterwards."

How are we actually going to get leverage and enterprise value out of this sort of big, enormous piece of free software we just put into the universe? And I think the pedigree of product manager at HubSpot at that time was also a bit different. There were folks who maybe started their time at HubSpot in support, and so intimately familiar with the product and with customers. Some of these people had closed thousands of support tickets and my background was a bit different."

And so I think to answer your question, I think I was just willing to take some risks and really push for the things that I believed made sense even though maybe based on the titles that I had at the time, I wasn't sort of inherently given a seat at the table and really pushed my away into some of these conversations and then was eventually invited to them.

You're like, \"Oh, that's an interesting problem. I think my team can help with that,\" so you absorb a bunch of context around how pieces of the business are connected and you can start to really widen your aperture in terms of the size of opportunities that might be in front of you that maybe you would've missed if you would've been so heads down on execution work.

So definitely a lot of upside, but certainly you got to be a little bit more creative in terms of that serendipitous knowledge sharing, the osmosis learning, and just context sharing that happens more organically when everybody's sharing the same physical space."

And so I find it very energizing. It is of course a lot of work to put it together.

But it turned out because there were services like AWS around by then, that that was actually quite easy. However, when it came to accepting payments in that business, it was just as hard as they had expected building hardware to be. They had to actually deploy some physical hardware, they had to do a whole bunch of these partnerships and it was very difficult, especially as an upstart, folks that didn't have any reputation yet to kind of be taken seriously and be able to correct into that. And so that's kind of the inspiration behind Stripe. So we started out solving a really kind of important and profound problem for these businesses getting started and scaling and obviously taking a very developer-centric approach to that in the early days.",
        "timestamp": "00:07:24",
        "text": "I think what's exciting to know about and important to know about next is as we've scaled, we really kind of figure out what to do based on paying really close attention to our users. Those are the businesses building on Stripe. What are they getting out of the products as they are today and what are the problems adjacent to the ones that we're already solving that they have to put a lot of their own energy into but really feel like they shouldn't and they'd like us to help. And when we find that confluence of kind of need and then adjacency to what we're already doing, that's usually our invitation to go and build the next layer of our economic infrastructure. So we think about what we do today is building economic infrastructure for the internet and beyond."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "So to bring this back to how do we attract the right talent and why does this matter? First of all, a lot of people, most people I think come to Stripe because they see that there is this great opportunity to help businesses at scale. So it really is about taking part in a mission that matters and are really motivated by that idea that we spend a lot of time with our users, the folks that actually need our help and are guided by them. And that mindset I think attracts a certain kind of person who wants to take a lot of agency, wants to understand the problems deeply and come up with their own ideas about how to solve for them. Because we're building infrastructure, it's also our approach that we really do think that we can do the best work kind of behind the scenes. We don't have to be out having the splashy launch, but hopefully all of our users can and we are quietly working behind the scenes to make their businesses better and more effective over time.",
        "timestamp": "00:09:02",
        "text": "And I think that attracts folks with a certain kind of mindset, which is the interest and kind of tenacity to dig into difficult problems that may not be obvious and obviously kind of attractive to everyone in the world then really plug away at them until we've made a tremendous amount of progress. And so it attracts folks that are long-term thinkers, that care about building and also actually want to work very collaboratively together. So when I think about what makes Stripe different to other companies, it really is this singularity of purpose. Our mission is increasing the GDP of the internet and building this financial infrastructure to do that and a tremendous amount of teamwork and collaboration to get that done. And so that attracts a certain kind of person. When we think about finding those people, we don't hide any of that. You have to care about that in order to, I think be excited about working at Stripe."

The next piece is really around how do you curate who you ask? I think there are two dimensions of this. The first one is the obvious one, which is a subject matter expert who really knows something about the topic at hand. So maybe a webdev themselves, for my example question. Another one, and this dimension I think is really important, is someone who knows you really well and can provide insight on how well does that work for you.

Can you pick your top two and tell me why you like them?\" Some people went above and beyond and scrolled through and gave me feedback on every single topic. Some of them just said, \"Here are my top two, and here's one I think you should avoid.\" I wanted to design it in a way where if you're a busy founder, you're a busy product person, which is the list that I chose for this curiosity loop, you would be able to sit down on your couch at the end of the night, read this interesting email and tap out a quick reply and give me that answer.

I guess I'll go through the four things you just mentioned. And part two is actually pick the right friends. But one is just, come up with a question that's specific. As in just like, what should I do with my life? But more, should I take the specific role at the specific company? Figure out the people that know you well and maybe have some context on this decision. How many people do you usually email for this sort of thing? What's a number?"

It creates a cadence of progress, which is incredibly valuable. It creates alignment. There's no question what the single most important thing to do in the company is, assuming you're doing radical focus and you don't have 20 OKRs every quarter. Ugh, don't like to think about that. And last of all, the thing that I don't see a lot of people talking about that I think is really amazing, is because an OKR focuses you for one quarter and at the end of the quarter you grade your OKRs."

SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 to your report can be a huge burden, especially for startups.

And if you don't know who the decision maker is and you're worried it's not, you just ask. Don't get stuck.\" Too many people get stuck and it makes your work terrible, right? What do we all care about? Progress, impact, momentum. If anything I would say about advice to people generally is be a force for positive momentum and it will be actually a real career maker."

I started off as a journalist at the Wall Street Journal and then found my way into communications and marketing at Tesla Motors where part of my responsibility there was to sit to Elon's right and make sure he had all the data he needed at his fingertips when talking to the press, which was deep end of the pool on the PR learning. And then after that, found my way to First Round Capital where I was really fortunate to be at the ground floor of First Round Review, if anyone out there watching this is familiar with those pieces. Was there for about five years. Loved that team. Really incredible folks. And then they had invested in Notion really early on, and so I was able to meet Ivan Zhao as a result of that and him and Simon, and they gave me the opportunity to join as the first marketing hire at Notion. And that's what I was doing up until recently."

So a lot of my work was, and this was a great opportunity, but driving around in the Roadster and talking to journalists and letting reporters ride in the car, which was very seductive and I think maybe just a little unfair from a PR standpoint. But in terms of what I learned, that was really the first job that I had that was necessitating just being incredibly on point with all the information. So making sure that I knew everything that could possibly come up in a conversation, being incredibly well-versed in just the topics at hand, I think that served me really well. I just have to be really, really, really quick and on it. And then the other thing that Elon I think is very talented at or definitely at the time really made an impression on me was painting an emotional picture of the vision that he was really going after and being able to convey the emotional quality of the mission to the people he talked to. So definitely at the time about the electric vehicle revolution and then space travel, I think he just knew how to make people feel about it that really enlisted a lot of hearts and minds and that is something that I've taken with me for sure."

It literally had an apartment on top of this loft space and it just felt like we were a group of people who lived there together during the day, but it had that kind of home spun really warm quality. So we all took our shoes off. There was beautiful furnishings and rugs and we would all just sit around and drink tea and work together on these couches. So it really had that feeling to it.

        "speaker": "So, it was a realization around this, timed with adjacent market shifts happening with DevOps that sparked the ideas behind Snyks. So, the founders, Guy, Danny and Assaf, they saw a real opportunity just to do things differently. They believed that the most effective way to improve application security posture was a developer-first approach. They knew that the developers were increasingly caring about the security of their code in the same way that they cared about performance and functional quality of their code. But they also knew that to empower developers to own that security, they needed just much better tools with way less friction than they ever had before. And their approach was, I think looking back, super smart, focus on a community. It wasn't the full extent of what we'd think of as community-led growth now, but it was close.",
        "timestamp": "00:11:35",
        "text": "They started with a really narrow, early focus. It was a single persona, single context, single use case, and what that meant for Snyk was developers building applications using Node.js who wanted to ensure that the open source dependencies they were pulling into their apps were secure. Now, open source software, that's a huge accelerant in building modern software. The average software application today is at least 75% of open source libraries and components. So, this was increasingly becoming a primary attack vector for malicious actors who could find a single vulnerability in an open source component and then find it and exploit it in every single application that was using that component. And at the same time, at least back then, open source software was much less tested for security vulnerabilities, and the maintainers of open source libraries were often less security aware. So, you get that context, and then at the same time, Node.js as a run time was gaining traction. So, there was this increasing adoption in the enterprise, more and more dedicated conferences and the like, but the community was still small enough that Snyk could meaningfully influence, and Guy and the others just went all out on being deeply involved in that community. They were presenting at dev conferences, meetups, they were building online content and so on. And the question that they repeatedly posed to the community was do you have known vulnerabilities in your apps, and Snyk was there to help them answer that question. And fun kind of fact on the side, if you search for Snyk in the Urban Dictionary, you'll see it's an acronym for so now you know. But all of this kind of I think really only worked because of the parallel product-led approach. So, while the answer to the question about how does your product monetize users was much less clear cut in the early days for Snyk, the answer to the questions, how does your product acquire and retain users has always been product led."

It's also the first opportunity that you have as a company to deliver on the promise that you made out in the marketplace. So I like to think of your brand is the promise that you're making and your product experience is your delivery of that promise. And those two things have to be in lockstep with each other, or you're going to have mismatched expectations and some really disappointed customers. So this is the first chance that a customer has to be really excited or really disappointed in what they thought they were getting. So don't mess that up."

And so we opened them up and we actually drove a car into the office with a pink mustache on the front of it, and then a bunch of drivers piled out of it and met the press members and were high fiving people and stuff like that. And then we also served a giant pink mustache cake at this event. So of all of the things there, that one sticks in my head the most."

If you're building a SaaS business, you're a construction worker, you're building the product and the features and selling it, and it's this very linear thing. For a marketplace, you're like messing with this ecosystem that you don't actually really understand how it works. And sometimes you might do something over here which drives this long-term effect two months later, and then you're going to be pulling your hair out two months later trying to figure out what you did over here that made that thing happen. So I think that the main advice is like to tread lightly. When you're messing with the core incentives or mechanisms of a marketplace, be very careful, particularly if you've got something that's working on playing with those variables."

And hopefully you do, or it's pretty close to it and you just have to adjust a couple things, and you could be right back on track. But if you just assume you need to launch a new channel to fix this problem, you're going to be wrong, because your entire customer base changed, not just the next 10% of customers that you're looking for."

But really it was how do I graduate college as quickly as possible because this is very boring. So I took a Poli Sci major. I am not a math or a computer science major. I didn't know what a consultant was because I was just trying to get out of college. I didn't realize people start looking for jobs before they'd graduate. So the last two weeks of school I was looking on Craigslist, because I was like, \"Craigslist is how everyone gets a job.\" I'm a first generation American student, so my parents could not help me at all with like, \"You should look into this company called McKinsey,\" or, \"Here are all of the life paths that you have ahead of you.\" So I ended up taking an investment banking research job."

How would I create a customer database?\" And so I ended up Google fooling all of the work needed to build a MySQL database, I presented a plan, and investment banking, surprise, surprise, is not very tech forward. So they looked at my plans and they're like, \"What is this MySQL thing? Isn't that super expensive? What is open source?\" So I ended up leaving that job because I realized that if I wanted to get into something more tech, it would probably not be at a investment bank.

I thought I have a kind of safety net, I must speak Indonesian really well just by birth, so maybe that's a great country for me to look at. So I took the approach of let's find a company that makes a lot of sense, that I feel I resonate with. And I literally cold called emails some companies. So Gojek being on that list. I literally emailed someone after Googling HR at Gojek and said, \"I'm willing to move to Indonesia, take a bet on me.\" And they actually did. So I got extremely lucky. Five years fly by insanely fast. I went through building out the data team from scratch. When you have all of the data, you know how much fraud you have in the system. So then I ended up building out the fraud and risk team, picked up performance marketing, and then it was like, okay, now we're ready to grow. So you have all of this data now take on growth."

If we're going to add 25 more, multiply it by four months, we're a small team, we are lost.

So if you think about Monday, it's basically a platform for work and you have different building blocks, columns is one of them, but we did the same deal exactly with dashboards and widgets, and then with automations, and so on. So I think this was so transformative, because, A, we understood that you need to constantly think, especially at these phases, how would you transform completely the product in the next three months?"

Check out this new feature.\" These popups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say, they just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone.

It's like the product function is an instantiation of the general concept of management. Being a chief product officer is not that different from being a chief whatever officer. You have to apply the same frameworks and concepts to get people to achieve goals together. But one thing that is absolutely universal that I think we, honestly, I think we forget it in Silicon Valley or a lot of people don't sort of internalize it, is that if you want to accomplish something truly extraordinary, if you want to be in the 99th percentile in terms of outcomes, it's going to be really difficult."

So, for us, we've hit over $200 million in annual recurring revenue before we even hit our one-year milestone since being launched. Which is pretty incredible. You, Lenny, actually have a really great blog post on how quickly it takes for companies usually to get to their first million ARR, and it's usually multiple years. So, this is definitely a unicorn, I don't think this is a standard. There's a couple of things that account for it, and we can talk about it, and the growth is only accelerating, so it's compounding, which is great. Because we had our 100 million in end of July, and just four months later we were at 200 million."

And it definitely made things more difficult for us, because yeah, when you fundraise, you just naturally get part of this kind of Silicon Valley industrial complex where people will, your VCs will tweet about you. You'll get the tech runs outlines, you'll get announced in all of the newspapers because you raised at this massive valuation. And so it made things more difficult us because the only way we were going to succeed was by building a 10 times better product and getting word of mouth from researchers.

She created the most used frameworks for measuring developer experience called DORA and SPACE.

We also chat about what incepted him to spend over half his life at this point on open source and creating WordPress. Also, why products like Llama are what he calls 'fake open source' and his perspective on AI and open source.

If you're the average ChatGPT user, and we have 700 million of them this week, you've probably been on GPT-4o for a while. You probably don't even think about the model that powers the product. And GPT-5, it just feels categorically different. I'll talk about a lot of the specifics, but at the end of the day, the vibes are good, at least we feel that way. We hope that users feel the same. And increasingly, that is the thing that I think most people notice, right? They don't look at the academic benchmarks. They don't look at evaluations. They try the model and see what it feels like. And just on that dimension alone, I'm so excited. I've been using it for a while, but it is also the smartest, most useful, and fastest frontier model that we've ever launched."

I'm especially excited about its performance on coding, whether or not that's SWE-bench, which is a common benchmark, or actually front-end coding is really, really good as well, and that's an area where I feel like there's the true step change improvement in GPT-5. But really, no matter how you measure the SMARTs, it's quite remarkable, and I think people are going to feel the upgrade, especially if they weren't using o3 already.",

I just wrote a big blog post that we published Monday, and this thing is such an incredible editor. And compared to some of the older models, it's got taste, which I think is really exciting. And to me, that's something that is truly useful in my day-to-day. And there's a bunch of other areas, like it's state of the art on health, which is useful when you need it, but again, the thing you can't really express in use cases or data is the vibe of the model. And it just feels a little bit more alive, a bit more human in a way that is hard to articulate until you try it. So, feel good about that."

I actually was at the AI Engineer World's Fair yesterday, and there was somebody, I think before me, giving a talk that prompt engineering is dead. And then my talk was next, and it was titled Prompt Engineering. And so I was like, \"Oh, I got to be prepared for that.\" And my perspective, and this has been validated over and over again, is that people will always be saying, \"It's dead,\" or \"It's going to be dead with the next model version,\" but then it comes out and it's not.

And so I tried out all these different prompts and ways of showing the AI what it should be doing, but at the beginning of my process, I was getting little to no accuracy. It wasn't outputting the codes in a properly formatted way. It wasn't really thinking through well how to code the document. And so what I ended up doing was taking a long list of documents that I went and coded myself, or I guess got coded, and I took those and I attached reasonings as to why each one was coded in the way it was. And then I took all of that data and dropped it into my prompt, and then went ahead and gave the model a new transcript it had never seen before. And that boosted the accuracy on that task up by, I think, 70%. So massive, massive performance improvements by having better prompts and doing prompt engineering well."

And that is just, you're using Claude, you're using ChatGPT, you say, \"Hey, can you write me this email?\" It does a poor job, and you're like, \"Oh, no, make it more formal,\" or, \"Add a joke in there,\" and it adapts its output accordingly.

And it's actually really flipped for me only in the last month and only with Opus 4 where my go-to product strategy partner is Claude. And it has been basically for that full year where I'll write an initial strategy, I'll share it with Claude basically, and I'll have it, look at it. And in the past it's pretty anodyne kind of comments that it would leave, \"Oh, have you thought about this?\" And it's like, \"Yeah, I thought about that.\" And Opus 4, I was working on some strategy for our second half of the year was the first one."

So that's probably the biggest shift that I've had is, I don't know about independence is the right word, but creativity and sort of novelty of thought relative to how I'm thinking about things.

He's like, \"I think we'll be at 90% by the end of 2025 or something like that.\" And sure enough, we're at about 72 now with the new models and we're at 50% when he made that prediction.

You get these insights from customers, you hear the language that they're using, which can be the sort of cheat code for how to message and position the product in market.

CZ, the founder and CEO at one point had 55 direct reports, and his direct reports had about the similar ones. For a large portion of the history of the company, there was just one level between the individual employees and the CEO. That leads to an extreme level of decision-making and execution.

I call it running products via daily meeting. We would pick a owner for something really urgent at the nightly leadership call. Then that owner would be expected to have all hands on deck for however long that problem is every single day and then report the updates on the daily call.

That extreme ownership culture, I think, probably was the most fascinating part of working at Binance that I've now tried to take. There's some good parts of it in terms of attention to detail, being able to pick certain areas and own it, irrespective of what your title is and how many people report to you. There are certain downsides in terms of the amount of randomization that it can cost teams, especially if it's not super well-thought through. I'm trying to see what are the great parts of that that I can bring to different roles, but that concept of daily meeting, if there's something super urgent, how can you own it directly and run it yourself, where you are in the details so your team knows that they need to be in the details, and then be able to execute that. That's probably the most fascinating. There's several war stories.

There's two types of engineer at Palantir. So, there's one that works on the core product and they're a traditional software engineer. There was a different type of engineer which you sent into the field. You would spend maybe Monday to Thursday and you would actually go into the building where the customer worked and you would work alongside them. You would literally get a desk there and so, that engineer became known as a forward deployed engineer."

So, people who got out of the military or one of the intelligence agencies and they were doing, let's say, an MBA somewhere to transition into the corporate world. And I think, typically, they would have taken a position at a classic Fortune 500 corporation. And actually, Palantir managed to get a bunch of that talent.

And I think the game that was being played there was, one, it's mission alignment. You're doing a defense company, that's the kind of person you want to attract.

And I think it's probably best understood by what it's not because we all fail on one of those two dimensions or both of them multiple times a day. So you can think about it as a two by two framework. On the vertical axis is care personally, the horizontal axis is challenge directly. What happens when we remember to challenge directly, but we forget to show that we care personally. That is what I call obnoxious aggression, and it's really important to distinguish between radical candor and obnoxious aggression. I think one of the mistakes that people often make about, and I've gotten a lot, you write a book about feedback, you're going to get a lot of it, and I've heard a lot of feedback that sometimes teams will be rolling out the idea of Radical Candor and someone will charge into the room and say, \"In the spirit of Radical Candor,\" and then they act like a garden variety jerk."

If I'm a jerk to you Lenny, then I'm going to send you into fight or flight mode and then you literally cannot hear what I'm saying, so I'm wasting my breath. But I don't know if this is true for you, but for me, there's a third problem. And the third problem is that when I realize I've acted like a jerk, when I realize I've landed in obnoxious aggression, it's not actually my instinct to go the right way on care personally. Instead, it's my instinct to go the wrong way on challenge directly and to pretend that I agree when I disagree, and then I wind up in the worst place of all, manipulative insincerity.",

If you watch The Office or any show about problems at work or problems in any kind of relationship really, you're going to see a lot of episodes about obnoxious aggression and manipulative insincerity. But I think the real rub comes and the fact that these, even though this is what we like to talk about, these two problems are what we like to talk about, these are not the most common problem. By far and away the most common problem occurs when we do remember to show that we care personally because you know what? Most people try to be nice people. So we do remember to show that we care personally, but we're so worried about not hurting someone's feelings or not offending them, that we fail to tell them something they'd be better off knowing in the long run. And that is what I call ruinous empathy. So that is Radical Candor in a nutshell. That's the TLDR. But please do read."

By not understanding the details under the hood right now, you then very quickly get to a place where you're kind of limited at a certain point, where you create something that's big enough that you can't change. And so I think some of the ideas that we're interested around, how do you give people continued control over all the details when they don't really understand the code? I think that solutions there are very relevant to the people who are vibe coding right now. I think that right now, we lack the ability to let the tastemakers actually have complete control over the software. One of the issues also with vibe coding, and letting taste really shine through from people is, you can create stuff, but a lot of it the AI making decisions that are unwieldy and you don't have to control over."

And then you'll be able to make that on a computer, and it will less be about this kind of translation layer of, you and your team have a picture of what you'd want to build, and then you have to really painstakingly, labor-intensive, lay out that into a format that a computer can then execute and interpret. I think less than the UI side of things, maybe taste is a little bit of a misnomer, but just about having the right idea for what should be built."

So I've always loved that we call things AI when they still don't quite work and then by the time it's like an AI algorithm that's recommending you follow, oh, that's just an algorithm, but this new thing, like self-driving cars, that's it.

It is the virality you can't measure that isn't a mechanic that isn't in a feature.

People don't switch to something that's better, and Linear is an amazing example of building an excellent product and actually succeeding, and there's a lot more to it maybe than just building an awesome product. So, that's what I'm excited to dig into and understand how you all operate, and I guess just based on these results, to me, this is the ultimate sign of product market fit.

It led me down this path that I'm now 10 years into with my colleagues of, well, how do we help founders learn those skills so that their venture investors don't fire them, so that they can actually go build whatever company they want to build and stay in the job for as long as they want to stay in the job? That's origin, that's what got me going."

We're going to sit there and actually talk about the work. This is made for us to actually get better at our jobs.\" We were pretty sold on it and it was never dogmatic.

I also got a competing offer from LinkedIn, and so at that time I made the choice to go to Facebook because I was interested in the social networking aspect of it.

So that's what happened. I got the marketing job. Cheryl also talks about when you are on getting a rocket ship, don't ask what seat. That was my foot in the door and here we are 19 years later."

I did that with my startup, I did that at Hewlett-Packard, I did that at Google and at Uber as well.

The reason was because the norm was that, firstly, the country's unmappable because there's no good addressing system. So how do you even look at places? Then the second one was there were always people around that you can just roll down your car window and just ask people, \"Hey, I'm going here and can you just give me guidance or directions?\" That was the norm.

How the loop works is someone can create a Coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create OKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those Codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it.

There's a chapter in there, he talks about luck and risk. What he says is, when you look at individuals and you think about, or you ask them, or you think about what they have done that have made them successful, we tend to put a greater amount of emphasis on effort and a little less emphasis on luck and risk. I think I strongly subscribe to that. The important thing when you look back is how much luck played a big part, and of course the risk that somebody took played a big part."

Among my colleagues and my fellow students there were a bunch of really, really smart people, so I just learned a lot from them and that gave me a great start to just go on and do something interesting. Right out of college, I started my own company and I did that with two of my classmates. One of them happens to be one of my best friends whom I grew up with who also came on the same scholarship with me to Singapore.

And by the way, play the long game. Once you find someone like that, stick to them. As long as they want to hang out with you, but just stick to them. Because you will go on to do multiple things over your career with the same set of people. And the shared trust and experience that you build with A plus people is just going to go a long way.

Not to be morbid, but just again, most of us just aren't really tuned into an awareness that our lives will come to an end. We try to pretend like we're going to live forever and just not think about it. And the horror of it is that we succeed, right? We mostly manage to just go live our life and eat ice cream and go to work and go on vacation and do what we do. To me, an awareness and mindfulness that our lives will come to an end punctuates reality in a way that requires me to rethink my priorities."

There's so many different definitions for product management, but the one that I have come to myself that I really like is, when you are building a product, you have this team, engineers, designers, so much potential. The purpose of product management, not the person, but the practice, is to convert that potential into as much realized value for someone as possible, right? Minimum loss. When you're just getting started with a new product, the people that should be doing that are the people who are building it. That's an engineer, that's a designer, that's a sales person or a support person. They're the front line of the smallest loop possible to get something going, and it's through those practices that I think you're able to get the most exposure to what it takes to build a good product."

Oftentimes, the critical voice in the head says, \"You need me to be productive,\" but it's usually a huge detriment to being able to really be successful. Even if you are successful with a really critical voice in your head, you never get to enjoy it. You might have the money, but then you're like, \"Oh, shit, I'm still miserable.\" Or, \"I got the car, I got the house, I got the money, I got the successful career, and why am I unhappy all the time?\" That would be, I would say one of the biggest ones. Another really big one that in a large category I would say is their relationship with emotions is all fakata. They are either trying to pretend they don't have them or compartmentalizing them or trying to manage them rather than harnessing them and falling in love with them. That would be a big place."

Okay, so the voice in your head, you have this really amazing insight that I heard on one of your podcast episodes that the voice in your head is often wrong, often contradictory, often telling you, and that your advice is to learn how to work very differently with this voice in your head, which a lot of people just assume, oh, that's just like what it is. It's telling me how it's trying to help me, but it turns out it's not. Can you talk about that?"

To be specific, I'm talking about the voice in your head that is critical and repeats. There's the voice that says the same thing over and over again. You got to work out more, you got to work out more, you got to work out more. Whatever that is, it's always wrong, and that doesn't mean there isn't truth to what it says, but it's incorrect. As an example of this, you should work out more, you should work out more, you should work out more, or you need me or you just sit around on the couch as a great example of one. If I was your boss and I was sitting right next to you and I was criticizing you every couple of minutes, there's no way that you would say, \"Wow, I really need you. I couldn't be productive without you.\" It's a bunch of crap. Or you should work out, you should work out."

It's, \"You should work out, you should work out.\" It's never an accurate thing that's happening inside of your head. Until you can see through that, it's hard to work with the voice in your head. You can do it, but until you see through it. The second part that I would say is that if you want to work with the voice in your head a new way, what most people try to do is they try to stop it. They try to control the voice in the head, and that doesn't work very well. Instead, I say, change the way that you relate to the negative voice in your head.",

What happens if you change the response to the voice in your head? That gives you a crap ton of freedom, and it's the beginning of what can be a state where the negative voice in the head disappears, which is really, really quite lovely."

So about 10 years ago, Twitch was acquired by Amazon for 970 million and we made something like 85 times our money. And normally, you'd think that's a really good thing, it was a good thing, but I had forgotten that I was even a shareholder of Twitch. So I had to go to my LPs and I had to explain to them, \"Hey, I'm sorry I don't have this in my financial statements, but do you want me to restate them?\" And they were all like, \"Nope, we're good. Just send us the money.\" And some of them even sent me bottles of champagne and stuff and the good kind. Then I started to kind of feel a little bit unsettled."

They'd put it in their journals and everything. I'm that way when it comes to startups. I have a database of any startup where you would've made more than a hundred acts on your first check. And what I want to do is I want to get a time capsule for those startups. I want to understand what did it look like not after it succeeded, but what did it look like at precisely the time you would've needed to decide whether it was an interesting opportunity. So I have the original pitch deck for what was at the time called Air Bed and Breakfast, which I foolishly passed on, and you seem to have made a good career decision in joining."

Jessica is also the author of one of the bestselling books about startups, Founders at Work, and hosts the Social Radars Podcast. She lives in England with her husband, who you may know, and her two sons. In our conversation, we dive deep into Jessica's superpower of being the Social Radar. She got this nickname in the early days of YC because she can read people incredibly well. This becomes a huge unfair advantage when you're evaluating and investing in early stage startups and founders, but also becomes useful in every part of your life. There's actually a quiz that I'm going to link to in the show notes called Reading the Mind in the Eyes that I suggest you take to see how you do, and it'll give you a sense of how well you are at reading people."

It's the external views, and it doesn't matter to me. Do you know what I mean?

Also, I had been spending so much time dreaming about Twitter and trying to mold Twitter in a direction that I thought was compelling and working with a team of people to do that, and to meet someone who also had a similar ambition, but obviously, in different ways ... He had his own dream for Twitter ... but it was really bizarre and unique and surreal seeing that glimmer in someone else who was like, \"Yeah, I also just bought this thing, so I can actually do whatever the Hell I want.

I majored in CS and minored in visual arts. And when I worked as a software engineer, I really missed the design side, and when I worked as a designer, I missed the technical. And moving into product was a really great way to kind of straddle both and have more touch points across the product development cycle. And so, I think that based on how you fell into it, you might have different spikes and different strengths and leaning into those is really important. But for the other things, it's also of course important to have a growth mindset and to constantly be conquering what comes next."

And a lot of these I haven't actually seen anywhere else and I've used a few of them and they are really great. So what I was thinking we'd do is let me go through the ones that I found most useful and interesting and just share your advice on those and then see if there's any I missed and then maybe add those at the end.

This notion of visualization as a tool of desensitization actually can be very helpful, but you're not visualizing the audience half naked. What you're doing is you're visualizing yourself in that space. You're visualizing the audience responding to you and what you're saying. So just like a pilot might do a flight simulator, having a visualization can actually really help you feel more comfortable and confident. It literally puts you in the room even though you're not there. And there's some tools and I'm fascinated by these tools that are virtual reality tools that can also serve to desensitize you. So this notion of seeing your audience in advance of actually speaking can actually impact your level of comfort. It's let's keep everybody clothed and let's keep them all focused on your topic."

In our conversation, we walk through the lessons that he's learned through his amazing career at YouTube, Facebook, Thumbtack, and at Grammarly. We talk about when it makes sense to kill your project at a company, when it makes sense to ask to be layered at a company, why you should be keeping a nose out for which products matter most at a business and to find those products, why you need to diversify your growth channels at your business, why you should be finding work that is going to most stretch you to help you advance in your career, a bunch of advice for creating space for innovation within a large company and so much more.

I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way?

So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective...

You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, \"Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever?

It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.",

We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see."

And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go?

So, I think Google has a very strong philosophy of we're engineering lab and that there's a lot of technology-driven, and a lot of pieces. They are not necessarily always trying to, I would say, cope with the market even, right? However, I think at the TikTok, I think besides the technology part, we do have a very keen, I would say, appetite to really understand what the markets really want and also how can we really service our clients in a better way and the clients here is not necessarily only for advertisers including our user and also creator altogether. So that's one of the things I think it's very different in terms of TikTok way of work. It's very customer-centric in a way, and again, the customer here is not necessarily only for the business partner but also for our regular user and creators on the platform."

So a lot of time, these are the things that I think TikTok is doing really, really well.",
        "timestamp": "00:07:14",
        "text": "The last piece I have to say is the approach for global prioritization. A lot of times that you see a US-born company go global and oftentimes still they are really rooted with the US market and there's nothing wrong with it to be honest, because this is the biggest market for them as I would say for East-born company. I think a lot of times that we can take approach with truly how do we think about globalization and for example, we launched a lot of product not necessarily first in North America. We launched it in South Asia for example, for our shopping, really very big initiative internally for shopping and we launched our really creator fund here in North America. We launched our gaming approach, really serviced our EUI gaming advertisers. Really, really strong over there. So there are a lot of different approach in terms of how do we prioritize our go-to-market and also product development. So that's the part I feel like we're very unique in the market or unique to some of that was the tech company born in the US."

The difference is actually how much you are willing to take the heavy lifting over there in the market. By that I mean really sending your troops into the market, hiring your local talent, understanding the culture and really understanding the behavior from those users. I understand the machine can do things, but also at the same time that we need to actually get local talent to fine tune the machine. So there are a lot of conversations about how I would say technology is able to change our life, but I do think that at the end of the day, I do believe technology is a tool."

And we're also a very, as far as company cultures go, very transparent and very open. So when there's problems or there's things going on, we tend to hear about them. And again, it was the first time that a lot of us had heard some of the things that were happening between the board and the leadership team, so very, very surprising."

People have built their businesses on top of OpenAI. We have tons of customers who love ChatGPT, so if something bad happens to us, we definitely impact our customers. But on the world scale, somebody else will build a model if OpenAI disappeared and continue towards this progress of general intelligence. I think fast-forward five or 10 years, if something like this would've happened and we hadn't gone through the hopeful upcoming work transformation and all those changes that are going to happen, I think it would've been a little bit, or potentially much worse, of an outcome. So I'm glad that things happened when the stakes are a little bit lower."

And I actually think, and this is my bulk case for the folks at TL Draw, I'm super excited for them to build what they're building, but they're sort of building this infinite canvas experience and you can imagine how, as you're interacting with an AI on a daily basis, you might want to jump over to your infinite canvas, which the AI has filled in all the details and you might see a reference to a file and to a video and all of these different things."

So you and your manager might come in and you can list out all of your priorities and then show you through just dividing up $10 where you're spending all of your time. And I've done this with people and we've sort of gotten down to like, \"I'm putting 10 cents here this week.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, what is that? 20 minutes, 30 minutes spending. I didn't think that's actually moving right.\" And so it's been great to see where people are overloaded and alignment on do my priorities stack up, but also am I spending the time on the most important things that could be moving the business forward?"

Second of all, I always think about it when I get nervous or anxious in a situation, it's really stuck with me. And I know that people in the workplace often get nervous and anxious doing all hand presentations, meetings, performance reviews, all the things. So I thought it'd be awesome just to dive into the stuff that you've uncovered about how we can become less nervous and less anxious. Before we get into the meat of it, I'd love to just spend a couple minutes just getting a sense of why you got into this stuff. What actually got you to spend so much of your energy and life force trying to understand how the nervous system works, how to get people to be less nervous and anxious."

About five and a half years into that experience, I went through burnout, which is pretty common in the startup world, but that actually wasn't the trigger for me. I find that usually people that get into this type of work, there's some kind of catalyst or some kind of challenging life event. And for me, that was October 23rd, 2017, and my fiance at the time had an anxiety attack and she took her own life. And that completely just destroyed me at the time. And I realized that I'd been so disconnected from my body and my emotions, and it sent me on this five plus year journey to discover all of this inner landscape that I'd been numb from the neck down, and I went into breathwork meditation retreats, did hundreds of breathwork journeys, researched with a breath lab over in Bali, and basically just kind of directed all of my focus and attention onto understanding this inner landscape that I'd been pretty much oblivious to. And since then, I've been working with founders, executives, running courses and teaching what I'm learning and hopefully still researching at the same time as well."

Most people when they try to calm down, they use tactical reframes or maybe mindfulness or maybe reframing the situation in a positive light. There's lots of different practices that people use which do have some effect. But in my experience, working with the physiology, using what's known as a bottom up approach, primarily using the breath, although there's also other approaches that you can use, it's just such a rapidly more effective way of shifting your state."

So if you're listening to this, maybe you, Lenny, you can try this as well. If you start breathing into your upper chest and shallow fairly, fairly rapid, maybe even through the mouth, that will then there's a part of your brain called the insular cortex, which is basically constantly spying on the way that we're breathing and it will register that change, it will then send information to activate the endocrine system, which then creates shift in our blood chemistry. The sympathetic nervous system gets activated and that increase in adrenaline and cortisol starts to flood your body. Everyone's probably very familiar with that feeling. And then that will then have a cascading impact on the thoughts that you're having and the way that you feel. And so you just shared, we have a tendency to kind of confabulate or make up stories that match the state that we are in. And so that's kind of what happens when we're breathing in that way. And then you can also consciously change your breath to breathe in a different way, which has the reverse effects, which I can go into, but I'll pause there."

It could be, \"Oh geez, we were fooling around in the back 40 and we discovered oil, what we do?\" Or it could be negative, could be that new innovation is driving us out of the market. But a challenge is the hardest strategy. The work comes from Strategos, which is Greek. The Greeks elected 10 Strategoi to serve as strategic leaders at Athens. And they were elected and they dealt with issues of the day, the Persians are invading, there's a plague in town, we need money for a new temple. And that's where the word comes to us from. It isn't just military, it wasn't in Athens. So strategy is always about dealing with an issue, a challenge, a problem. What are we going to do about global warring? What are we going to do about China wants to reunify with Taiwan?"

And it began to dawn on me at some point that this is a strategy. These are analytical tools for analyzing the problem, for thinking about things, for looking at competition. But they're not strategy. Strategy is, one, and I started to write a book and the first chapter of the book was... the first part I wrote was the David and Goliath strategy story. And my point in writing about David and Goliath was that the surprise that David is able to beat this giant warrior, and that's a strategy story. Strategy story is about discovered strength."

And my wife Kate asked me, \"Well, do you define strategy?\" I said, \"Oh, it's really hard. I can't define it.\" And she said, \"Well, you can't write a book about it if you can't define it.\" Because I said I had this other conceptual scheme in my head that all teachers and writers had, which is that there's a bunch of analytical tools. And this is back in 2005, 2004.",

        "text": "And I gradually came to the realization all strategy is problem solving. It's a form of dealing with challenges, and that was a basic idea going in the book. So if that's the core of it, what's the basic activity? What are you doing when you create a strategy? Well, you're diagnosing the situation. You're trying to figure out what's going on here. What's the nature of reality that you're dealing with? Now, humans can't understand all of reality. No one can. So part of what a diagnosis is, is a decision about what you're going to pay attention to and the hypothesis for several hypotheses about what's going on, how do things connect together. And that's beginning of the diagnosis. And so diagnosis is an understanding of the situation that you're in. Well, that's not novel. And you can use any of those tools that are famous for that and you can try to find forces. You can do any one of a number of things to try to comprehend the situation. The world is more complicated than 2x2s, unfortunately. I was educated as an electrical engineer and my early years were spent designing spacecraft for NASA. And when I got into looking at business and business strategy stuff, I was always amazed at how unintellectual it was, that I was struggling to master Z-transforms and multiple, and yet these people are looking at 2x2s and little diagrams [inaudible 00:10:19], oh, that's what the company's about. So a rich diagnosis of the situation, but then a guiding policy."

Because a good researcher is like the repository of insights you need for growth, but they're not there. They don't participate in the decision. So they end up doing research. They have jobs to do, so they do research that is too reactive, it doesn't matter, and then it's less impactful.

That's my favorite thing to do, is to actually get concrete with people about what their specific challenges are. But let me back up here. So, this is what I spent five years writing a book about, because why did it take me five years to write a book? Because I was so distracted. So, I wrote this book for me more than anyone else. That's the only reason I write books. It's not because of what I know, but because of what I want to know. And I discovered that there were so many myths and tropes and just flat out harmful things that I was doing to hurt my own productivity. And when I really went down to first principles and looked at the research, I found that there were so many things that I was doing wrong."

I'm in the best shape of my life at 45 years old. I have a better relationship with my family than ever. I'm more productive at work than ever before, not because I didn't know what to do. That's what I find is really emblematic of people today is not that we don't know what to do. It used to be maybe, okay, our grandparents, they didn't know what to do because the information was scarce. They had to go to the library and look things up. Well, today, with the internet, we all basically know what to do. And if you don't know what to do, Google it. You can find the answer out there.

If you want to do better at work, you have to do the hard work that other people don't want to do. We already know these things. What we don't know is how to get out of our own way, how to stop getting distracted. And so, that was certainly my problem. And so, what I wanted to do was really dive into the problem because the conventional solutions didn't work for me. When I have a problem in my life, I'll think about it, I'll write about it, I'll talk to friends, I'll talk to my wife about it. If I still can't figure it out, I'll read books about it. And what the conventional wisdom out there written by a lot of college professors that are all tenured is stop using technology, stop checking email, get off social media. It's melting your brain, but that's not very helpful, right?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "And what separates traction from distraction is one word, and that one word is intent. I love this Dorothy Parker. She said, \"The time you plan to waste is not wasted time.\" So, I think we need to stop medicalizing and moralizing what people do with their time. Why is it that someone going on Reddit or on social media or watching a YouTube video that's somehow morally inferior to watching a football game on TV? It's not. Anything you want to do with your time and attention is fine as long as it's done with intent, as long as you're doing it on your schedule, and not someone else's, certainly not the tech company's schedule. So, anything you do with intent is traction, anything else is distraction.

Versus a market that doesn't really have that momentum to it, you're going to have to build something really big and fancy to make any progress. That's why we care less about market size because really, what you're looking for when you're looking at a market, are what are the dynamics of change, what's the current and momentum that's going to pull the company and make the job easier for the founders to actually build something that endures."

It felt to me like it wasn't obvious that those metrics that they were all getting very attached, and focused on, and showing in these presentations was the wrong thing to focus on. It didn't get to the heart of whether they were on the path to building enduring consumer social product. They were missing, at the core, the criticality of engagement.",

I started just to go through that process that you've gone through many times before of writing and distilling it, and that's where I came up with this hierarchy. What you realize when you look at social products is that they're almost is this action which I call the core action of that product that forms the foundation of the product. When a user completes this action, it's clear that they both understand the utility of the product, they understand what that product is all about, and it's an action that, if they perform the action, they're very likely to come back. So for Facebook, the obvious action is friending, in the beginning days. For Pinterest, it's pinning. I don't know if you're an Evernote user. For Evernote, it's writing a note. When you perform that action, that means you're an engaged user. Of course, there's a lot of other actions that you have to do. You can follow people on Pinterest, you comment on Facebook. But the end of the day, if you're not doing that action, you're not really a user to the product. That's why the MAU thing doesn't really mean anything. It's really looking at, I think, of users completing the core action. You can look at this as a cohort, weekly, daily, whatever the right cadence is. But that's the foundation, that's level one."

Because to be a storyteller means you have to separate yourself from the herd, and in their mind, that risks them getting picked off, right? Getting picked off by some predator. But the alternative is you're in the herd, which means you're forgettable. I mean, how many times have you gone to a conference, listened to someone speak, and by the time you're pulling into the driveway, you really can't remember anything that they said? Because that's what happens if we don't speak in story. Our minds are not designed to remember a pie chart or facts or statistics or platitudes or ideas that are not attached to imagery. So the risk you take if you're not telling stories is that you will be forgotten. 100%. You will be forgotten."

I actually joined Maui Nui Venison earlier this year, after hearing their ad on the Tim Ferriss podcast, and I'm excited to be spreading the message further. Not only does this company provide the most nutrient dense and protein dense red meat available. Their operation produces the only stress-free, 100% wild harvested red meat on the market, that is the only one of its kind in the world, actively managing Maui's invasive axis deer populations, helping to restore balance to vulnerable ecosystems, food systems, and communities in Hawaii. Also, it is seriously delicious, not at all gamey, and easy to cook. My wife and I made stew, and steaks, and all kinds of grilled goodies with the meat.",

They don't realize they can take the afternoon off to spend it with their kids. They've created this implicit contract that Monday through Friday, eight to 10 hours a week you have to work.

And I'm able to play with it a little more.\" I had one friend, he said, \"From your book, I made a list of the four priorities. Right now I'm getting three of them. And it's helped me become more aware that I'm actually getting these three things that I prioritize. I'm missing the fourth. I'm probably going to have to make a change two years from now. Maybe another role, because I do want to lean into that fourth thing.\" I think it's really just about remixing your path. My hot take is that we're all on a pathless path. You were at Airbnb. Airbnb, every two years were there was a different company."

And it's an important observation, because what that means is the marketplace's customers aren't just the people buying the rides, they're buying the listings. Actually, the hosts are Airbnb's customers, and the drivers are also Uber's customers. So both sides of the marketplace are the customers of the platform. Both sides depend on the platform to help the platform take that friction away. Because just like you want a place to stay or you want to ride, the driver is at Uber because he wants to earn money by taking people places. And the host is on Airbnb because they want to earn money by selling their listing."

But also, I'm going to do this other thing, and I'm going to take 20 minutes doing that.\" And so, what we used to do is, what I used to do with people was map out their social network, all the people in it, their family, their friends, how they communicate. We'd map on all the channels, we'd talk about what worked well, what didn't. And, we did this with dozens and dozens of people over the course of maybe 18 months.

That building had a different key card. If you didn't work in Google Plus you could not get in. All sorts of counter-cultural things at the time. And, as a result, there was a lot of antagonism internally for Google Plus. And so, when I left in the middle of the project, leaving with all of the plans in my head to the enemy, some people saw me as a traitor, understandably.

Today my guest is Lane Shackleton. Lane is Chief Product Officer at Coda where he's held the role for over eight years. Before that, he was Group Product Manager at YouTube, a Product Specialist at Google, and as you'll hear, he started his career as an Alaskan mountain guide and then as a manual reviewer of Google AdWords ads. Lane is an incredibly deep thinker, very first principles oriented, and has built an incredible product team and culture at Coda. In part, he's done that by studying the principles and rituals of great product leaders and great product teams. In our conversation, Lane shares what he's learned, what he's found great PMs and great teams do differently. He shares a bunch of his favorite rituals and principles, how you can implement them on your own team, plus a really clever and unique way of understanding if you're making progress in your career, plus so much more. I could talk to Lane for hours, but we tried to keep this to under an hour and a half. With that, I bring you Lane Shackleton after a short word from our sponsors."

But I definitely grew up with those stories and reading a lot about him as a kid. In high school we read Endurance, which is a great book if you haven't read it. It's an amazing story. Very inspiring how he put people first and brought back all of his men from this journey to the South Pole. So have taken a lot of lessons from that, but that's as close as I can come to the greatness of Ernest Shackleton."

Just loved spending time in the mountains and climbing, things like that. To be honest, I wasn't the best guide. There were a lot of amazing guides out there that just had ... They were almost invincible in terms of their ability to climb for 20, 30 hours. But I learned a lot from the experience and maybe the quick story on why I stopped guiding. I was on what is a dream trip for mountain guides, which is we were flown to a remote portion of southeast Alaska. It's an hour long flight. Mountain called Mount Fairweather. Beautiful 15,000 foot peak. And as a part of climbing on glaciers one of the things that you do for context is you're roped to another person. And the reason that you do that is because if someone falls in a crevasse, you want to be able to stop them or pull them out."

I still don't know how many people know this. I think people think that we had some secret backdoor deal with Apple for distribution, but we just had college students making Apple podcast accounts and then submitting hundreds of thousands of podcasts through these accounts, and I think that was a really big part of why we got so much hosting market share so quickly because it was such an insane benefit over the other platforms which otherwise had been commoditized at that point."

As an example, you have three of your own podcasts on Spotify and I checked them out and they're all very highly rated, so they're not just like bullshit podcasts, they're real people actually listen and enjoy them. So my question to you is just why is dogfooding so important to you? How do you actually operationalize it? And then also maybe just talk about these podcasts that you have."

And then finally we've also got an enterprise product where we take the underlying infrastructure that's powered those products that we've built, and embed them in the banks, and products that people use every day, and then zooming into the numbers. So, we've got to come a little way on the journey. So today we're now moving about $12 billion a month, growing between 30 to 40% year on year. We take about 0.65% on average across all our routes as price, and we've been profitable for about more than four years now, with 20% EBITDA margins."

We talk about the lean approach, we talk about fail fast, [inaudible 00:04:28] and so on and so forth. And I think that that was a necessary phase for us because a lot of innovation was just the ideas of founders unvalidated by customers, and we needed this inflection point in our discipline. People need to understand though that customer science is not the solution to everything otherwise OpenAI will never have done anything. It's also innovation.

In B2B SaaS especially, which is much easier to circumscribe is where I start to think about, look, how do you tell from the beginning? Because an investor as well as an operator. Now to segment this space, I think of two dimensions. One is how many departments in the company does the workflow you're trying to solve apply to? Is it just a few or is it all of them? And the second is how intense or how frequent is the workflow executed? Is it daily? Is it weekly? Is it three times a week? And so on and so forth. Now if you draw a nice quadrant of these two things, then you can start to have some predictive power. Things that are useful in every department I call every one workflows, like things like collaboration, like Slack, email, calendaring, workflows, social knowledge and Notion and so on and so forth.",
        "timestamp": "00:06:04",
        "text": "And then things that apply to single departments, I call niche and that's what I call niche. And then the intensity is about frequency. A month is not infrequent, daily is super frequent. If you divide the market or the enterprise into frequency and into how broad the workflow is, you can actually have predictive power. And what I found by looking at the biggest company is public and private in each quadrant was that every one frequent workflows intuitively are the most profitable to work on, but also the hardest to get into because they're dominated by Microsoft and Google and very, very large companies. For example, one of my friends is the CEO of Coda. And so this is interesting, because he's in that space, for him to think about."

        "text": "Well, this isn't a static framework in the sense that companies are not destined to be one of these things. The essence of strategy is to navigate from the curve of travel is essentially go from the lower to the higher. Atlassian is trying to go from high niche to high everyone with Confluence and with all the tools that they have. People below are trying to get into the high frequency niche by focusing on their core customer. So what it looks like in say low frequency everyone workflows, something like that is, well, if some people are using it infrequently, but they must use it, well that's a good thing. But then maybe you provide a module that is used by the finance department every day, and so suddenly you're moving into the high frequency everyone workflow. So it's about finding a part of the organization that considers this mission-critical and then solving their problems beyond the problems for everyone for example, in that quadrant."

How to get started if you want to start running experiments at your company. He also explains what actually is a P value and something called Twyman's law, plus some hot takes about Airbnb and experiments in general. This episode is for anyone who's interested in either creating an experiment driven culture at their company or just fine-tuning one that already exists.

So you can think about the feature sets if you're an Asana user like goals, portfolios, projects, tasks, reporting, all of that. But really, we want to help people answer the question at work, \"Who is doing what by when, and why?\" So that notion of clarity of purpose, clarity of plan, progress, and responsibility are often so painful in people's work lives. When there is certainty there and clarity there, people can be much more efficient in getting the work done. So that's where my focus is every day. I'm a product leader for that group."

On the planning front, we have really changed what altitudes we're planning at, the time horizon we're planning at. Some of the inputs have gotten a lot more precise and opinionated. So, for example, we have always had pillar plans and team plans, but maybe we didn't have an intermediary layer of an area perspective. Well, what's an area perspective? Well, as your organization grows, we've had to reorganize to create more agency and accountability close to teams that are focused on specific target customers and problems. So if you think about the way Asana is organized, we've got our R&D, the pillar structure, the areas within them, and then the working teams."

If you took a step back, what we were really trying to do is to be like, \"Hey, not everyone trusts Airbnb in terms of... It's a platform. It's not like it's managed inventory, it's not a hotel. How do you go in and really make sure that all the Airbnbs are meeting the quality bar?\" But I do think we were very solution-first, and I think we're also competitor afraid at the time. So it was during a time where there were managed marketplaces, there were the Sonders out there, and I think that as a company we're very much like \"[inaudible 00:07:36] what are we going to do in the world of managed marketplaces?\""

You're like, \"When we get to the scale of X, it's all going to work out. We can make these things happen.\" I think you actually need to really make sure that unit economics work quite at the beginning. That is definitely one lesson. And I think the other thing is, and going back to spirit of what are you trying to achieve. If you're trying to achieve this idea of really knowing the quality of the place, and for a platform like Airbnb, the right way to go about doing is through our reviews, through our guest reviews, which are essentially free as opposed to literally sending out inspectors."

If you take people that are just super smart, they've never done it before, one advantage of that is they can innovate because I think they come in with, I don't know anything. Let me just figure this out."

I think about a billion dollar valuation to essentially ... I think when I left we were 1,500 people and we're valued at 10 billion at the IPO. I think the things that Dropbox got right, one of them was definitely hiring. So when I think about 2013, Dropbox was actually known in the tech circles as a place that was very selective, very difficult to get into. You could have an amazing resume, and Dropbox was really selective about the type of people they brought in. So I think they looked for two main things. They looked for first principles thinkers, so not necessarily your experience, but how do you approach problems, how do you know the right questions to ask? And then create your own framework around that."

And initially I think when you have scale, you're getting a lot of signal on what is resonating with the user. Initially, you also don't have ... It takes a while to build out the features for enterprise. And so as you're building out the product-led motion, you have probably larger companies in your self-serve base and they are often knocking on your door.",

        "text": "This happened at Dropbox being like, \"I need you to build SSO for me. I need you to build all these enterprise grade features. It's not secure enough.\" And so you are also collecting the list of things you need to build on the enterprise side. And so I think it's typically looking like you might start product-led, then go enterprise. And then the other direction I've seen is some companies initially are just more conducive to an enterprise in sales motion. Potentially, you need to build custom things for these users. It's also not a bottom-up motion. Maybe the way you sell the product starts with the legal team or the finance team or some important stakeholder, but then a lot of companies now are trying to make that shift to make the product more accessible and go product led."

And at some point Mark kind looks over, says, \"Hey, we saw your presentation, saw your strategy. Now when are we going to start seeing results?\" And that was my introduction to Facebook. It was kind of my introduction to working with Mark and was a pretty kind of intense thing to go through. Again, I just joined. The strategy was very much a draft at that point, but I think what it highlights is something that Facebook does really, really well, which you get very quickly when you join Facebook and it's why they're such an execution machine and can build a lot of great product.

It's something of course that we focus on a lot at Shopify, but it's that difference between, \"I don't care how hard you've worked. I don't care what you're working on, what the activities are. What are the outcomes? What is the impact you're having?\" I actually really love that word impact and focusing on it because it's vague enough that it covers off any work that is impactful towards the mission and it's precise enough to know what does that mean when you say, \"Are you having impact? Or what is the impact we're having?\" So it's a great way to approach things. That was my first experience there within a few months.

I guess I don't know what the question is exactly, but is that just what you find in the work that you do with all the companies you work with? Just how important it's to come back to impact as maybe the primary thing?"

Nancy is a bestselling author, speaker, and CEO of Duarte Incorporated, which has helped create over 250,000 presentations for the world's most influential business leaders, brands and institutions including Apple, TED, Google, the World Bank, and famously Al Gore on his Inconvenient Truth presentation.

The effect ultimately that we've seen from a human capital point of view is displacement. We have more people now than we've ever had, but the nature of the work that they do is more strategic. It's more about modeling, validation, asking the right questions, being focused around creative levers. And less so the like trench work of implementation and bid modifiers at the keyword level on Google search, and some of the really hardcore manual analysis we had to do."

Today my guest is Jonathan Becker. Jonathan is a legend and an OG in the world of performance marketing. On this podcast, we've done deep dives into the many aspects of growth, including SEO, sales, conversion optimization, retention, product led growth, product led sales. But this is the first episode where we get super deep on paid growth. For the past decade plus, Jonathan and his team have planned, built, and executed more than $3.5 billion in paid acquisition budgets for companies like Uber, Asana, Square, Masterclass, Tempur-Pedic, and many more. And they've built their agency, Thrive Digital, into one of the preeminent independent digital marketing agencies. In our conversation, we get real deep into all things paid growth, including what's changed with recent privacy shifts, why focusing on creatives is the new biggest opportunity within paid growth. How to think about attribution, and what's changed there. What to look for in people you hire to run paid growth for you, how AI is already changing how paid growth teams operate, and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Jonathan Becker after a short word from our sponsors."

I didn't know anybody from the TED community at the time. So we have dinner, and then afterwards as it goes at conferences, there's an after party. And so essentially I hop into a taxi, everybody else sped off in their cars, or however which way they were getting there. And as we're talking to the driver saying, \"Hey, we're going to this place, can you take us?\" There's a knock on the window and the person outside says, \"Hey, I think I'm heading to the same destination. Do you mind if I hop in this car with you?\""

And when we start having drivers pick up orders and pick up passengers, these people would actually physically assault our drivers. We've had everything from bricks thrown at our drivers to knives and machetes being brandished at them, and I think it would've been easy for us to say like, \"Hey, they're all contractors. They're third parties, let them kind of just sort it out.\" But instead, we actually hired private security. So we actually work with private security companies to help our drivers in those situations, to help kind of extract them out of these sticky situations.

We call it D5, D7. A lot of other companies call it L5, L7. But the human explanation for that is how many people turn to Arc at least five days a week? That is all we obsess over from a metrics perspective, because for us it captures retention, engagement, and growth in a single metric. You can't game it. Right? So from retention perspective, it's not just opening it accidentally once a week. You need to open a tab on a day in order to count as an active for a day.",
        "timestamp": "00:06:01",
        "text": "But so it tracks retention. It tracks engagement because five days a week is no joke. There are very few apps or pieces of software you actively use five days a week. And then, obviously, it tracks growth, because of we track the count. So that is what we track. And then we also don't obsess over absolute numbers, because if we're successful, if you zoom out and out and out, any point in time will be inconsequential and small. So, what we really look is growth rate week over week. So, relative to last week, what is our growth rate? And for the past eight months or so, we've been growing over 10% every single week. So very, very thrilled with that. Do not think that will continue If anyone is listening. I would be shocked if we continue like that for another eight months. But, yeah. We obsess over how many humans use Arc five out of seven days a week. And we really want that number to grow as fast as possible every single week."

Today my guest is Laura Modi. Laura and I actually worked together at Airbnb for many years where she was director of hospitality, leading all of the work around strengthening the host community and also improving marketplace quality. After leaving Airbnb, she went on to found a company called Bobbie, the only female-founded and mom-led organic infant formula company in the US which basically every mom I know uses."

Just, I reflect back and it's one of those experiences where it probably was transformative because you do get an opportunity to work on so many different things. So I remember joining and I was just put in charge of leading and growing parts of customer service, vendor management. I mean, we were scaling the team so fast on that side. It quickly shifted into taking me to Europe where I led our consolidation of our European offices in Dublin. It was so funny. I remember at the time being asked to go do it and thinking, am I being asked purely because I'm just the only Irish person in the company right now? But it was one of the biggest operational changes that we went through there. And then for the last few years I was the director of hospitality leading global host community and host operations."

That is higher than a high yield savings account, while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year-high. But buying US treasuries is super complicated. If you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash and the US treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account. You can access your cash whenever you want, even before your treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days. Just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield. Public will automatically reinvest your treasury bills at maturity so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield. And you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8% a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a treasury count at public.com/lenny.",

Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools. We're trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue You discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. An Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end e-mail marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10 x your experiment velocity."

Do whatever you can to grow there, show your manager all these things. I see people keep spreadsheets, it wins. So it can come up with performance reviews.

The average time a report has the same manager in corporate tech is only about 10.8 months, so just under 11 months.

Today my guest is Lauryn Isford. Lauryn was most recently head of growth at Airtable. Before that, she was a product growth lead at Facebook, working on user growth, internet.org, and growth of Facebook at India. Before that, interestingly, she led growth for Blue Bottle's e-commerce business. In our conversation, we dive deep into Lauryn's favorite topic, onboarding, why it's one of the biggest and most undervalued growth levers, what she's learned about optimizing onboarding flow through her work redoing Airtable's onboarding flow, what she's seen work and common pitfalls around onboarding, plus a ton of advice around figuring out your activation metric. I could talk all day with Lauryn about growth, but we had to cut this off to keep this to a reasonable length. Enjoy my conversation with Lauryn Isford after a short word from our wonderful sponsors."

That is higher than a high yield savings account while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year high, but buying US Treasuries is super complicated if you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash into US Treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account, you can access your cash whenever you want, even before your Treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days, just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield. Public will automatically reinvest your Treasury bills at maturity so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield, and you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8%, a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a Treasury account at public.com/lenny.",

It's a great shared space to work closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and iterate quickly and easily on anything you're working on. For example, in Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming with sticky notes, comments, live reactions, voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team sprints. Your whole distributed team can come together around a wireframe and draw ideas with a pen tool or even put mocks right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready-made template, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmap to customer journey flows, final mocks, you get the picture. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny."

        "text": "Yes. So, experimentation is a really big part, growth culture, growth hacking culture, PLG culture, growth marketing culture, any kind of growth, at least in my sphere, and sometimes teams can be really, really dependent on experimentation when trying to grow a business. A great example of this would be consumer growth at scale. Think your classic big social company. I worked at one of them. I am a former employee of Meta back when it was called Facebook. When you're at scale trying to grow a social app, experimenting can feel second nature. It can feel like a necessary step in your product development process that you want to drive more signups or you want to drive better activation with new customers. So, you change some buttons, change a design, and A/B test it, and then see if numbers go up or down, and then make your ship decision based on it."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "I find that there's generally two reasons why a grow team wants to experiment, and one of them is to understand more precisely the metric impact of what they're building and what they're putting in front of customers, and the other is risk mitigation where you're making so many big dramatic changes that there's some risk that while this could be really great for the business, it could also be really bad and it would be good to understand that before everybody's experiencing that in production. So, with that framework in mind, sometimes you don't need to experiment. Sometimes if the business, let's say activation, right, activation rates go up 6% versus 7%, that precision actually doesn't help all that much beyond being able to say in your performance review, \"Hey, I increased activation by 7%.\" So, it also is expensive to have folks on the ground, be it engineers, analysts, product managers, spending time understanding the results of an experiment that could otherwise be spent on road mapping, on foundational analysis, on shipping things. So, experiments can be expensive.",
        "timestamp": "00:06:09",
        "text": "So, with all that said, generally my advice is to experiment when you need to and to primarily see it as a risk mitigation tactic when you're making dramatic changes and to let the product development process do more work. So, spend more time with customers, be more rigorous in understanding precisely what problem you're solving, get mocks in front of people and see how they react, and hopefully have more conviction than you otherwise would when you ship something that it's okay if every customer sees it tomorrow and that the experiment doesn't actually matter as much."

And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid.

I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, \"Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever?

My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.",

We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us.

I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go?

But if they heard it in an email, in a group chat, in any kind of thing where they were sitting next to or they're hearing it along with other people, it wasn't personalized, it wasn't one-on-one, that is terrible.

And so I looked around and thought, well how could I do that because I'm not a coach and so why would anyone listen to me? Then someone told me that there were students at Stanford that had started companies but no one would coach them. They couldn't get into YC because YC doesn't accept students. So, I went and started coaching them and it was super fun and very successful and then they started recommending me up the food chain and eventually, I met folks like Naval Ravikant and Sam Altman and Brian Armstrong and they recommended me around to the rest of the tech community, and ended up coaching some of the CEOs and the leaders of the biggest tech companies and biggest tech investment firms."

My first career was actually not in tech; it was in medical devices. I was a GM for a company based out of France and also overseeing West Africa business for them. After doing that, I moved back to the US, launched my own startup, which didn't work out, and then I moved to the Bay Area roughly eight years ago. In the Bay Area I wanted to become a PM, which was really hard to get into. At first, I joined a startup, series a company, became head of product for them, and then join Slack as the first PM on their growth team. Then from their, help scale the growth team at Slack. When I joined revenue was around 50 million; when I left roughly four years ago was 10x that. And then after Slack I recently joined YouTube Google about two years ago. At Google I'm a product lead at YouTube, where I'm driving a product called Primetime Channels, which actually recently launched in November in the US. And in that product, we're bringing streaming services to YouTube so that users can watch their favorite movies, shows, and sports content."

I think you mentioned that's how you got into the PM path or I guess...

My background's actually in product marketing and product management. I started my tech career at VMware back in the day, tons of amazing, fun VMware diaspora. And then I started a software company called TalentBin, it was a recruiting software company in, geez Louise, 2009. We quickly realized that, \"Man, this B2B software stuff doesn't sell itself, irrespective of maybe what people say on the internet,\" at least back then.

It's not like, \"The product's done, throw it over the wall, have fun, kids.\" It's a loop, where the minimum viable version of your product is probably going to suck and then in order to get to the minimum valuable step, you've got to be interfacing with a lot of customers and that's a sales behavior, getting in front of people and being like, \"Hey, I think you probably have this problem if you look like these other folks right here.\"",

Internal tools are something you probably don't think about until you have to, or it probably didn't even occur to you to think about them, but if you work at a big company, you probably have a bunch of one-off custom apps or dashboards that are laser focused on just one job to be done for one specific team or just one role, and they're always such a huge pain to build and maintain. And that's why I'm such a big fan of Retool, and why I think Retool is so popular. Retool allows teams as small as just one person to build a suite of custom internal apps in a fraction of the time that you think it takes. The productivity gains of custom apps is now within reach, not just for large enterprises, but for small teams as well. And as you scale your company, Retool scales with you."

I often say that the best product people are not the people on Twitter and LinkedIn sharing advice, but the people who don't have time to do that because they're too busy doing the work. Peter is the epitome of this. He was VP of product at OpenAI where he oversaw product design and engineering for ChatGPT and helped ship ChatGPT Enterprise, voice, memory, desktop, custom GPTs and more. He also oversaw and built their first growth team. He was the first Head of Product at Instagram where he worked closely with Mike and Kevin, and oversaw all product development, including on content sharing, ads, growth, even helped build out their design and user research functions. He was also a Head of the Rider product team at Uber where he oversaw everything in the Rider app, including big improvements to pickups and drop-offs at Uber Pool and airports."

        "speaker": "He also helped the team launch new products including Uber Reserve, which is now approaching a $5 billion a year business. He also spent nearly 10 years at Facebook as their 4th ever Product Manager where he built and led the team behind the current Newsfeed product, the standalone Messenger app, also photos, and groups, and homepage, and profiles. He was also Chief Product Officer at Airtable where he helped the company systemize how they built products and transitioned to Enterprise. He also led product management at Oculus. These days he is General Partner at Felicis where he is able to bring everything he's learned to more founders as an investor. He has never done a podcast before or shared any of these lessons or stories publicly. So, you are in for a real treat.",

Why are we spending? Why wasting time just arguing it through?\" So those became really powerful. That's on the clarity of thought, clarity of execution is even more important because many organizations actually reach a decision, they don't act on it, which it's one of those shocking things. They decide this is a top priority, but it doesn't make its way into the organization. And I'll give you an example. Somebody will say, \"Hey, my top priority for my business is this initiative.\" And then I'll say, \"But most of your engineers are working on this migration.\" And they'll say, \"Yeah, we have to finish that.\" I'm like, \"So why don't you say the migration is my number one priority?\" It's like, \"Yeah.\"",

Their company was on the brink of failure. They had their last attempt and they decided on a path forward and after they decided on a path forward, he was still seeing people hedging in different directions and it led into this confusion in the system where we decided people are still hedging, they're still trying out things they thought could work, and he realized that unless they basically all pull through in the same direction, there is no chance they'll be able to be successful."

And for me, I get attached to clarity and focus. I think that's much more important. That's why I think when I say I don't mind being wrong, it really comes from a humble place. I would rather go forward with everybody in the same direction than necessarily try to hedge all the time, which will give me no chance of success. The way we start, we do this in our product gens right now, is we actually spend some significant time on what is the problem we're trying to solve for, but not high level, not like, hey, we want to launch this product, we want to launch a video product."

Figma Make is a different kind of vibe coding tool.

Basically means that change is happening faster than we're able to respond to it. Now, LinkedIn has this unique view of the world of work.

Where other tools stop, Datadog goes even further. It helps you actually diagnose the impact of funnel drop-offs and bugs and UX friction. Once you know where to focus experiments, prove what works. I saw this first hand when I was at Airbnb where our experimentation platform was critical for analyzing what worked and where things went wrong and the same team that built experimentation at Airbnb built Epo. Datadog then lets you go beyond the numbers with session replay. Watch exactly how users interact with Heatmaps and Scrollmaps to truly understand their behavior. And all of this is powered by feature flags, that are tied to real-time data so that you can roll out safely, target precisely and learn continuously. Datadog is more than engineering metrics. It's where great product teams learn faster.",

It's customer success, it's support, it's partnerships. And the reason I say that is my experience throughout my career has been that those functions often have this Venn diagram strategy where marketing's pursuing one thing, it overlaps with what sales is pursuing, but not perfectly, which also overlaps with what support is pursuing but not perfectly. Examples of this would be slightly differing segmentation frameworks, et cetera."

Today, it's completely different. Every company is an AI company. We also chat about her take on how she sees AI impacting humanity in the future, how far current technologies will take us, why she's so passionate about building a world model and what exactly world models are, and most exciting of all, the launch of the world's first large world model, Marble, which just came out as this podcast comes out. Anyone can go play with this at marble.worldlabs.ai. It's insane. Definitely check it out.

But Figma never felt like it was for me. It was great for giving feedback and designs, but as a builder, I wanted to make stuff. That's why Figma built Figma Make.

This interview is following a theme that I've been following through a bunch of interviews, which is the evolution of how AI models actually gets smarter. Along with scaling, compute and improving the actual model code, much of the improvements we're seeing in ChatGPT and Claude and every frontier AI model is these labs hiring experts to filling gaps in their knowledge and correcting their understanding of how things work, and basically showing them what good looks like in every domain that consumers are using models."

These things were not necessarily in fractions at the time, but we were just being practical. It was basically a project that we had started, and so we built the search engine and people started using it and we thought we would get in trouble, but it turned out the computer science department was excited about it even though we had basically parked a domain on their servers and we were using our own computers in the dorms to serve up this website and product."

We were in LA, so we were at UCLA, so we were not quite wired into the entire Sand Hill Road scene. And as we were doing the deal, the terms kept changing on us. We thought you went and raised money and it was like, \"Oh, we'll get a few million dollars at a $5 million valuation.\" This is back when that was actually a series A valuation. And then over the course of the deal, it was like, \"We're doing the deal. We're not doing the deal. Oh, you should give us 50% of the company. Oh, you should give us 75% of the company. Oh, if you want to sign the document today, this person's going to show up for breakfast and if you don't sign today and give us 80% of the company, the person's not going to show up.\"",

There is just the way that you can negotiate your way through the world, which I actually think influenced Travis heavily and then me later heavily at Uber in terms of if you can imagine it and it makes sense and you can align incentives, then it can happen. But there is no way. And to learn that at 19 or 20 years old I think was highly imprinting."

And at the time, the laws were on this were pretty ambiguous because we weren't, mix tapes were legal, but this was like a hyperversion of that. But we were eventually sued for a quarter of a trillion dollars. So I guess if you're going to experience something that's potentially as life devastating as that, doing it when you're, I think we were 21 or 22 at the time is the time to do it, but it was just this very cold splash of water about how the real world really works, because the MBAA and the RAA were the ones who sued us, the entertainment industry sued us or the associations that represent the entertainment industry, and then they settled it for $1 million."

So take coding, or mathematics, or law or finance, they are focused on collecting high quality data that really improves the state of our capabilities, their models, and you can see a lot of these popular benchmarks on what are called model parts. When Llama IV is released, you'll see the benchmarks across various domains, and each one of the research teams inside of the labs have different use cases. Basically they're running experiments, almost think like the scientific process. They have a hypothesis around how to improve the model. They're trying to collect small pieces of data to see if that hypothesis works out. If that hypothesis is proving true, then they expand the overall collection of the data in that advert.

Okay, so before we get into the insane trajectory that your data labeling business is on, which is just an amazing story that I think a lot of founders and product teams that are trying to navigate this AI disruption that's happening will have a lot to learn from. I want to first help people understand what the hell data labeling actually is. Just like, what are people actually doing? Why is this so valuable? Some of the most, I don't know, fastest-growing companies in the world today, including you guys are just, this is what you do. Clearly there's something really important here. I sort of understand it, probably not really. I think a lot of listeners feel the same way. So let me just ask you this, what is data labeling actually? What are people actually doing?

There's a pre-training and a post-training process in training a model, and for a long time these AI providers, or LLMs, or Frontier Labs we're focused on basically sucking up more and more information on the pre-training side of the house. And that's basically the entire corpus of written human knowledge. So, that's not just written, but every YouTube video, every book, basically the pursuit of sucking up everything that was on the internet, and that was the pre-training side. And there was a lot of gains from pre-training, like models continue to get better. And about 18 months ago, 24 months ago, we started to really see an asymptoting of gains coming from, because they had essentially sucked up all of the knowledge on the internet. And so, labs really shifted towards most of the gains now coming from the post-training side of the house."

There's still very much, a lot of the labs are still, they have points of view on what data collect. It's evolving very quickly. But I think reinforcement learning is really preference ranking, like which question do you like more, question A or question B? SFT data is a prompt and a response, and obviously the labs are very focused on these thinking or reasoning models. So, in order to improve a reasoning model you need to actually have the step-by-step instructions, of which when you interact with a lot of these frontier models they struggle in very advanced domains. And so, I think there's a variety of data that they're working with to improve capabilities in their models."

So, in order to break a model, it's pretty tough for the average person to break a model and get an incorrect response. But if you are a PhD in physics, you can go in multiple subdomains of physics and prove where the model's actually breaking, either breaking in its reasoning steps or it's where it's broken in its ground truth right answer, or we start throwing tools in there or needing to follow some step-by-step process. And I wouldn't say it's easy for them, but the average person cannot break the models and that's where we really come in."

The story of Intercom's transformation into Fin is incredible. Their traditional business was valued at billions of dollars, was making hundreds of millions of dollars in ARR, but growth started to plateau and was even about to go negative.

We had this post COVID sugar rush, which a lot of big companies at that stage did in 2021. Everyone's valuation and revenue was through the roof and that hit a lot of problems in a lot of these companies and we had five quarters of success of sequential decline in our net new ARR and we were about to hit $0 net new ARR which means we would've in negative growth territory. We never got there. I managed to stop it before we got there, but we were falling each quarter and I found that I, despite my wishes to go and have new adventures, still had a lot of pride for this damn thing and didn't want to see it.",

So, that was when I felt like I need to go back and I need to make a change. I went back and one month later ChatGPT was announced, so it would be really neat and tidy to be able to say that the AI transformation came, I knew I couldn't be on the sidelines, I had to save this thing from the coming disruption. Actually, I got whacked across the head by this AI thing, but it also ended up being a gift."

But we had a number of AI engineers in the company already, and so when GPT 3.5 came out, they said, this is different and it didn't take long for people to start to imagine that this is going to be pretty disruptive to service. And it started where we imagined that this was going to just wreck everyone selling seats, everyone in the conventional SaaS game."

Dmitry is global head of product at Revolut, which is a finance super app offering customer savings and checking accounts, crypto, investing, joint accounts, even mortgages. Not only was it last valued at over $60 billion, but in the research that I've been doing into which companies hire and incubate the best product managers, Revolut was right at the top alongside Palantir and Intercom. And so in our conversation, we dig into what Revolut has learned about producing and hiring great product leaders, including a focus on ownership, having people solve really painful and complex problems while making the experience wow and lovable by users. Also indexing towards hiring really smart and driven people early in their career versus people with a ton of experience in the space and so much more. If you're looking for a job that will accelerate your product career or want to help your product team level up, this episode is for you."

In the US if you travel from state to state, things are different, but for example, you always pay in US dollars, right? In the UK you pay in British Pound. If you travel to mainland Europe, you will pay in Euro, but if you go to Switzerland, you'll pay in Swiss francs. If you go to Sweden, you'll pay in Swedish Krona and so on and so-and-so. Overall, there are 25 different currencies and every time you were traveling and paying in a different currency, banks were charging you exorbitant fees on top of terrible foreign exchange rates, and that's when Revolut launched as a multi-currency card and people loved it."

And yeah, I mean, in the time since then it's obviously developed a lot. I think in terms of practical skills, there's some comparisons we make. Sometimes we kind of say, well, when we got started it was kind of like a high school CS student and then as time went on, it became more of a college intern and now it's like a junior engineer.

And I think today folks generally know how to use chatbots and to with chatbots, right, and that's an interface that people are familiar with and obviously with agents it's still like a real curve, I think to learn how to use them and how to get the most out of them. And so it's really exciting to see a lot of others starting to build and do a lot more in the agent space as well.

At the time, we actually started out building GPU virtualization and compiler software. Before this, I worked in autonomous vehicles. My co-founder, who I had known since middle school, worked on AR/VR at Meta. And for us, we believe deep learning would touch many, many industries. It wouldn't just touch autonomous vehicles. It would touch financial services, defense, healthcare. And we believe these applications were hard to build, these deep learning applications. So we made it possible for you to effectively run these complex applications on computers without GPUs, and we would handle all the complexity of being able to actually run the workload on the GPUs for you. And we were able to optimize these workloads a ton."

At the time, we were free cash flow positive. But I think what we felt was once these generative models started to get very good, we sort of felt a lot of what we built was not as valuable. And this was a very, very hard moment for us at the company. We were only eight people at the time, but we felt, \"Hey, would people be training these very bespoke sentiment classifier models anymore that were very, very custom models? Or would they just ask GPT-N, is this a positive or a negative sentiment?\" Probably it's going to be the latter, right? And in a world in which everyone was going to run generative AI models, why would an infrastructure company be a differentiator? Because everyone is going to run the same kind of infrastructure down the line.",

And in that case, what we should go out and do is build the next great apps like Google, like Amazon. And we vertically integrated and actually took our infrastructure, our inference infrastructure to go out and build Codeium at the time. And at that time, we were early adopters of GitHub Copilot and we thought the coding space was going to get tremendously disrupted in the next coming years. So we actually took our infrastructure, we ran our own models in massive scale. We even trained our own models."

And it's not just building a static site, or something like that, but you can actually build full stack, real software with databases, and hosting and et cetera, just from prompting.

But that data just hasn't come. And you see this happening with Cursor, you see this with a lot of these other AI startups. And the value proposition is real. The free market is filled with rational actors. People are coming to these tools because it is solving problems, they're able to do way more for way less cost, than it would otherwise. And that's why I said, I think we're going to see more of this, whether it's in coding or other verticals, or whatever. In a sense, it's almost like maybe the new normal, as AI just continues to get better. But, anyways."

More recently, he wrote a book that summarizes all of his advice for founders called Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution, A Handbook for Entrepreneurs. In the foreword to the book, Steve Wozniak said, \"This book will change your life and become your Bible if you are an entrepreneur,\" and I cannot disagree with that.

And in my background, I'm an engineer always looking for the simplest way, and solve a problem is the simplest way, and so this is where fall in love with the problem coming from, and people occasionally would confuse the T-shirt with the book, and now the T-shirt is about 10 or even more years old and the book is only two years old, and so I was wearing those T-shirts for a long while before I wrote the book and when I wrote the book that was obvious that this is going to be the name of the book, but they are way more into that, right?"

Just imagine that we will be here in 2007, just before I started Waze, and I will tell you I'm going to build an AI crowd-source based navigation system and you're going to say, \"Oh, yeah, very interesting,\" but you don't care.

Think of a problem, a big problem, something that it's worth solving, something that the world will become a better place if you solve that and then ask yourself, so who has this problem? If you happen to be the only person on the planet with this problem, I can recommend you a therapist. Don't build a startup. It's way more expensive and takes way longer period of time to build a startup. But if a lot of people actually have this problem, what you really want to do next is go and speak with those people and understand their perception of the problem and only then start to build the solution. If you follow this path and your solution works, it's guaranteed that you're creating value."

In this conversation, we go deep on one very specific topic, crisis. As Uri shares in his book, building a startup is a journey from one crisis to the next. And my goal with this conversation is to give you tools to handle the next crisis and the next crisis and the next crisis that you face as a founder. This topic is so important that Uri decided to update and re-release his book with a whole new chapter dedicated to managing crisis.

You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks. What is the sure things to get growth? What is the sure thing to get that metric up? How can I contribute to success with the company the fastest way possible? All of these shortcuts and obviously in the age of social media where everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks and this and that, people are grasping for oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern or simply not even applicable to their type of business whatsoever."

Lucky for you, the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS. Organizations like Ramp, Dorada and Electric use Merge to access their customers' accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases in their product, or HRAS data to auto-provision and deprovision access for their customers' employees. And yes, if you need AI-ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. So want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all?

Duolingo is a $14 billion business, just over the past six months, they doubled in value, they're hitting all time highs in usage and market cap, they're also one of the very few successful and also the single biggest consumer app business in the world.

In our conversation, we get extremely tactical and in the weeds on how to actually do sales as a founder. We talk through each step of the sales process, and Jen shares what you should be doing and saying at every step. We go through how to find your first set of leads, how to reach out to them, what to say in your message, how to structure your first sales call, how to get through procurement, and how to get that final signature."

Some people say don't judge a book by its cover. I'm the opposite, where any book... The cover of the book should be giving you incredible insight into what is on the interior of the book and setting the tone and setting the vibe so that when you open the book and read the book, it's a symbiotic thing where you're like, \"Oh, I understand what I was getting into.

If they get venture money, they have a little bit more. But what they don't want to do is spend venture money on a massive brand exploration when you're still in the hiring process, you're still trying to get early stage engineers, and all that kind of stuff, and so I am sort of a weird contrarian in this way in the brand world where brand people are like, \"Brand is everything. You need to take a significant investment in brand because that guides the vision of the product or whatever.\" But I think being a bit more of an insider within the tech world, I understand that sometimes people start companies and have an intention to do something.",
        "timestamp": "00:08:24",
        "text": "While they're doing that, they're building the team, they're doing cool stuff, but then the company has to pivot for one reason or another, whether a competitor immediately comes out with a thing that you're doing or the technology that you're doing gets postponed, whatever's going to feed into it, and so if you invest super heavily on the whole brand vision from the jump, sometimes it's like throwing away money if you have to pivot. What I love about the work that I do is that I understand that a lot of people have to just have something to put on decks and have something to put on a holding page or whatever, and internal teams are totally capable of doing that early work. But then if it does become successful, you don't want to get locked into whatever it is that you had to throw together before an investor meeting or something."

If you're like me and most users that I've built product for, you're probably used to chatbots at the bottom right of websites, where you ask a question and it says something like, \" Check out these three helpful articles. Did that answer your question?\" And then you click away and then a few seconds later you get bombarded with some other useless pop-ups. For those of us who work on software, no one wants their product to feel like this. Command AI is an AI power toolkit for support, product, growth and marketing teams that embeds in your company's product. The AI support agent can deflect upwards of 80% of support questions, providing actually useful answers, and it can magically co-browse with your users to show them around your interface. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful.",

So the first makes you look better. Now this is super basic and very crunchy, but it's a bad habit that a lot of people have. That when I am trying to gather my thoughts or think, people tend to look down. And if you're looking down on Zoom, it's three times as bad because it looks like you're looking at your phone or looking at notes if you had any, but even when you're in person, it doesn't look very confident. And so you're suddenly giving off of that vibe of, oh, this person feels a little bit uncertain here, and maybe it's going to look like you stopped speaking and you might get more interrupted.",

That means you look more confident because anybody who'd be willing to pause in their speaking is somebody who's confident. And as a result, you're much less likely to get interrupted.

Public speaking is something it's just is very scary to me as it is for a lot of people, but it's just something I really dread. Even doing these podcast episodes, every time I get nervous before doing these things, as much as it may not seem that way. So this is not my natural habitat speaking, being in public.

If you were to start saying, \"Okay, I'm going to transform my fitness,\" and you start lifting weights and you start going on runs, obviously your muscles are going to get bigger, you're going to get more in shape, and your cardiovascular system is going to improve. But that's actually only a sliver of the impact it's going to have on your life because you're going to start feeling more energy, and you're going to start having these nice hormones, these endorphins flowing through your body and you're going to feel better about yourself. And when you walk in front of the mirror, suddenly you're going to have a boost in confidence.

So as you get breakthroughs, how you feel at work feels different. How you feel in your group of friends feels different. How you feel in a group of strangers, especially, how you feel and your family can even be impacted. This seeps into everything else in your life. But the thing is, because there's so much self-consciousness that goes with speaking, we often feel kind of constraints under the layers of overthinking and anxiety that come with speaking. So it can be hard to realize that underneath these layers, you actually have this extraordinary superpower, because as humans we're evolved to speak, this is what we are. So you don't need to teach a baby how to speak, it will learn by itself with no formal education. So what that means is, we all have this incredible hardware."

It's the last thing I think about is the speaking part. I'm completely in tune with whatever it is I'm trying to convey to my audience or the person in front of me. And the goal is to get into a flow state and stay in that flow state all the way through the finish line.

It's our job to translate the complexity of the brain into really simple, straightforward systems that you can remember. The three or four main systems to stack on top of each other like layers, start with the fact that the brain has systems.

Some of that has to do with personality, which predisposes us to have a higher-anxiety or a lower-anxiety response or a higher-creativity or lower-creativity response. You can also be more intentional with these pathways, and that's a big component of self-awareness is to know what are my preferences and then am I actually letting those preferences take over in the situation or might be more intentional steering down the pathways to activate these best regions and systems of the brain.

By the way, I have a cold. For people, if in case you wonder why I sound a little weird, but the show must go on. I want to start with just setting a little context for folks that aren't super familiar with performance marketing and paid growth. When we talk about performance marketing/paid growth, first of all, are those two terms interchangeable to you? And second of all, what falls under the umbrella of performance marketing/paid growth?"

Typically, when I talk about performance marketing, it's about online only, but you could argue offline could be performing and affiliates could be performing and stuff like that. They can be interchangeable, but I would recommend if you are talking about it, to specify which one you're talking about. Because when you do say paid, because I'm in the industry, I would just, \"Oh, they do Google Search and they do Meta and they do things like that.\" But if you do offline and you just say paid, we may be talking about things, but missing each other on two ships passing in the night. So I think historically, people, when they have said paid growth, have been fully focused on just online."

If you look at the way each platform is doing, Google introducing AI, plus with paid taking up the first four spots, you have to scroll pretty far down to get to an organic listing. Meta, it's almost a pay for play now. You have to do promoted posts for people to even see your content. I would say it does depend on the industry you're in. If you're say, leaning heavily into influencer marketing, that is still a paid component. You may not be doing Meta ads, you may not be doing paid search, but that is a paid component. But I would say at baseline, everyone should be doing paid search. The way I usually explain it to people is paid search is user driven. You have to type in a relevant keyword for your ad to show."

I think the other benefit of course is the business leaders control the roadmaps so they get to dictate the work. They know that they have help and resources in that area when they need them. So that certainty, that control, I totally understand the value there, but I think that those are two things that you can solve for if you know that those are the biggest issues with a central team.

I went to a pretty hippy-dippy K through 12 school in Baltimore, Maryland where we were really asked to think about why we were in school and to pick any of the courses that were of interest to us outside of AP programs or grades or any particular requirements. You really got to choose your own path. And I recall one particular class in high school, which was somewhat a science class, but it was called the History of Science, and we actually walked through and studied all of the, at the time, best understood ways the world worked in science, but then later were turned out to be wrong, right?"

It was fascinating. That particular teacher employed another trick on us during that class, which was it took the tuition fee of our school and divided it by the number of hours and wrote the cost on a ticket and then handed us in the beginning of the year. Tickets for every single one of the classes and he would stand at the door and you would have to give him a ticket at the end of the class that he thought it was worth it. And just like that practice of deep intellectual understanding of how people evaluated something at the time and choosing for yourself to spend the time on it by just the physical act of handing that ticket to the teacher.",

I was a bit unprepared and I remember actually taking a microeconomics class that was quite advanced and had a close friend and we studied exactly the same information. We sat and looked at the same cheat sheets, we practiced the same quizzes, we read the same books, and he got the top grade in the class and I got the bottom and that's from where that quote came from where the professor said, I think you should bump, potentially bump down. I was like, \"I already know that stuff. I'm interested in this topic. I'm going to try to improve, but look just because I'm significantly worse than the other kids in the class that has little to do with if I should leave.\" And he was particularly cool with it."

You've seen a lot of this happening at Atlassian, you've been there for over 10 years at this point, and Atlassian has, I don't know, over a dozen different product lines at this point, something like that.

We have a lot of markets that we play in, which means that we've got a lot of competitors. But basically when we look at the areas we could go in, there's an endless list of areas that we could go in, play and have a decent chance to win. Much harder to do if you're a startup. The breadth that we've got makes it easier to try find areas where we could expand into. We're not starving like a smaller company, so we can actually afford to try to play somewhere, to do some bets, to have some of them fail and some of them succeed, so that's amazing. Now our customers, I said 300,000. The thing that I admire the most about the Atlassian business model is it's very broad. It's across small and medium-sized companies. We have startups using our products, and we've got also enterprises and very large enterprises using the same products, which means that there's a lot of areas where we could find a niche and go after it and expand progressively into all these areas so there's a massive distribution potential that comes with that. When I worked on Jira Product Discovery, I didn't start with, okay, I'm going to need to start finding product managers and it's going to be how to find them. No, they were already all using Jira. Atlassian is a company that has a relatively deep organization hierarchy but relatively flat decision making. So it's more like a, imagine a network of key decision makers across the organization. It doesn't really matter the job title or whether you are a manager of people or not. The decisions are made by people who drive change."

It sounds like decision making is efficient relatively, it's flat. You have all these different customer segments that use all these different version product lines of Atlassian. It's just like all of the opportunity possible to launch new products and still, many things do not work out, so I think this is a really important point and I think many big companies are in this. We have so much opportunity. Everything we're going to build is going to, it's going to grow like crazy because we have everything we need, but still it doesn't work out.

The other class, by the way, is Touchy-Feely, which we dove into last month. In his class and in his recent book, the Seven Rules of Power, Jeffrey teaches the things that you can do in your life and in your work to build your power, and through that get things done and advance in your career. As one student described the class, it's the cod liver oil of the Graduate School of Business. You know it's good for you, but you feel a little nervous about it.

They bear almost no resemblance to how we think the world ought to be. They bear a little resemblance to our aspirations. And I think we look around the world and we see people who have acquired enormous amounts of power and have used it for bad. But I tell people, I see people with hammers hitting other people on the head. That does not mean that a hammer is not a useful tool. You can take a screwdriver and stab it into somebody's belly. I have a very dear friend who we'll probably talk about later in the podcast. Laura Esserman is a breast cancer surgeon, and I tell people, Laura has a knife. She uses it to cure cancer. Muggers have knives. They use it to rob people. So I think we've confused the tool for how it has been used."

The second thing that I would say, and this is very intentional from David, and Ed, and Chris, our founders, is we have a culture at NewBank, which is the most alive in our employees' minds that I've ever experienced. Having worked at Google, and Facebook, and other places like that, I would bet that probably 80% to 90% of our employees could recite the five values to you if you stop them in the hall."

These guys are taking this seriously.\" And a lot of my interview process from my side was really vetting if that was real, or if that was a sign on the wall.

And when there are hard decisions to be made, we bias in favor of the customer. The customer's love, will they want to tell their friends, and neighbors, and family about it? And so I think that's the heart of it."

You make sure that you focus on customer discovery before you start building. You make sure that that discovery is focused not simply on asking the customer, but on innovating on their behalf. You make sure that you take techniques from all over the place, from Procter and Gamble, to Google, to you name it, of maybe you can't ask the customer to tell you what massive new innovation they would love. You've got to observe them, and find their pain points even when they aren't noticing it.",
        "timestamp": "00:10:49",
        "text": "And then as you build, you commit to measuring whether they in fact love the product, not fooling yourself about that. And iterating like crazy over and over and over again until you get it just right. So those are some of the principles, but I think the trade craft follows the focus on finding a real deeply held, emotionally held pain point, and a culture that says, that's your North Star."

While it is important to know at what stage of the career you are and what kind of a product that you are working on, the very first thing that anyone, when you're starting off, produces is outputs, okay? The output can be launching a product, it can be analyzing and running an experiment, and it could even be just being a part of the team and contributing to a go-to market strategy. So focus on that output significantly. As you get comfortable with output and you start getting comfortable with working with different stakeholders, you start controlling what outputs are necessary, which is when you move to the outcomes. Outcomes are product areas, goals that you can own and or collaborate with other stakeholders on."

That's not necessarily what you need to obsess over, which is actually what I recommend to people is just find ways to have impact. So this is really interesting. Your advice is early in your career, focus on just getting stuff out and done. Don't so obsess with the impact. Can you talk more about just what, when you say output, what are you describing there? Is it just ship products and be helpful and produce something?"

For instance, if you are sourcing content for your homepage, what are the different avenues that you can source content from? What is the easiest to source? What is the most difficult to source? Just ranking it all in that order goes a long way. And one of the product managers actually did that yesterday and I went, wow, it just made my life so much simpler. And not just my life but so many other people's lives so much simpler, and we were able to take that specific output and use it as part of our overall strategy. If that PM would have obsessed about the overall content strategy, overall how we are going to do it versus just how we are going to be sourcing it, they would have indexed on something bigger and maybe would have not even been able to make that impact. But now, they were able to show something which was a small part, which was an output, but it fell into the overall outcome."

You have your customers, which in a way, are your listeners and the people that are engaging with your content. So in a way, you're a B2C business, but in another way, you're a B2B business. Obviously, you have sponsors and you're trying to attract really great guests to come on the show, and so there's a second order piece of the press is validating that you're something that a software company wants to sponsor. So internally, they're making those decisions. Not everyone might know Lenny's podcast, but they could send around a CNBC article and see that this is something very legit and something that people care about. It just signals that third-party validation that I think is really important, and that ties back to, when you look at a SaaS company or something and they're making decisions, having that validation, I think, and that credibility goes a really long way."

So I think, yeah, that's the value from the B2B perspective and it's not necessarily going to directly drive signups, but when that AE is sending their sales emails and they can link to a story, I think that really helps. Also, candidates too, when you're reaching... If it's a recruiter reaching out on LinkedIn and they only have 100 characters to make their pitch, linking to that story can be really powerful.",

        "text": "So those are some of the second-order effects for B2B. And then, on the consumer side, it's a much more complex issue. There's affiliate marketing, which is this whole world of paid, where you're getting product reviews and that sort of thing, and that's not really an area that I'm an expert on, but we do work with some consumer companies where press is a major driver of growth. So for instance, Perplexity, they have invested essentially zero in any paid marketing, they don't have a marketing person even, but they do do PR. And so essentially, after their most recent announcement, they saw a massive spike in growth, a massive spike in signups, pro users, all of that. And I think, in that case, the reason PR works so well is..."

Maybe they're not going to read eight paragraphs that you wrote about your business, but if it's in the format of an article, I think they're more likely to take the time to do it. One other, I guess, aspect of it is content. So for instance, the articles that people want to write about you are not about necessarily how great your podcast is, which it is, but more about how you created this business. And so it's more through the lens of you're an entrepreneur, you have built this media empire, and so that's not necessarily the kind of story that's going to drive your core audience to sign up, and so contents is part of it, too. And so we work with companies where we get them great stories about their company culture and cool initiatives that they're doing, because reporters are interested in that topic. That's not going to help their sales, but it might help with something like recruiting. And so yeah, I think thinking... That's the other piece of it, is thinking through the content."

And we were at a leadership retreat, and we were supposed to... At the time, I was a program on effective product leadership, how to be a great product leader, product executive. And the biggest thing that companies wanted at the time and teams wanted was their teams to be better storytellers. And it's still something we hear today, which is, \"To be a great product leader or leader in general in any industry is you got to be a great storyteller.\" And so at the time, I was teaching and facilitating storytelling workshops and exploring that with teams. And it was a few people on this team specifically who I so appreciate their honesty and candor here, which is what this giant tech company is known for, very blunt people working there. And they pulled me aside halfway through the offsite, and they were just like, \"Honestly, storytelling is not going to fix our problems. This is silly.\""
      },
      {
        "speaker": "And what they were able to tell me is that their leaders wanted them to be more effective by having greater influence. And these are terms that we throw around all the time. Be more influential and be a better leader, whatever that means. And what was happening on the ground with these executives was that they were all fighting. I'd hear, \"Oh, the head of engineering is such a jerk,\" or, \"This person won't listen to me,\" or, \"My team is demotivated. And I get it, but they need to step up and work more.\" And there was just a lot of conflict going on here and there that storytelling wouldn't fix. When that happens, and I talk about this in the book a bunch, no one wants to hear your stories. You have to actually be able to connect with people and to work with people and feel good as a leader in order to really step up and lead. I didn't have an answer for this team at the time, and I left this offsite just honestly feeling terrible and not knowing what to do about it except telling them, \"I think you got to go work with a coach because this is beyond my pay grade.\"",

Telling stories was not the answer, and so I ended up spending what now is the next decade figuring out, all right, how do you become an effective leader? And of course because I can't do anything lightly, once I went down that path, I ended up switching up my entire business. And now that's all I do is help people be better, more effective, confident leaders who really make the impact that they want to make."

And in some ways, it's very reflective of Reed Hastings as founder of Netflix. So when he founded Netflix and grew the company over time, it was with a belief that there could be a different approach to building a company that would make it a place that people thrived in and loved being and would feel different than other places, both in the quality of that talent density, but even more importantly, the excellence and the outcomes. And that that's where people would derive a lot of sense of fulfillment. So it is very deeply seated at Netflix from its original days. And in order to do that, you have to really hold yourself to a lot of stuff that doesn't feel like natural human behavior."

When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This was a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group of peers.

Check out this new feature, and these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day, and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product, growth, marketing, and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them."

This works for web apps, mobile apps, and websites, and they work with industry leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny, and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan.

And in her book Dynamic Reteaming, Heidi delves deep into why change is actually good for your teams, why you're better off not having super stable teams, how to effectively execute reorgs, and through that, how to reduce attrition, stagnation, and knowledge silos. In our conversation, Heidi shares the five types of reteaming, anti-patterns to avoid when making org changes, what sort of team structure is most conducive to creating totally new products, why being transparent about your reorg plans is definitely worth considering. Also, how Heidi became such a great listener with a lot of really interesting insights and advice there and so much more. Huge thank you to John Cutler for introducing me to Heidi.

If things aren't changing, there's not going to be all of a sudden, \"Hey, we have this new role that we want for you.\" I don't know. A lot of the leaders that move up quickly are the ones that seem to take advantage of change and think ahead and get involved and position themselves in a way where like, \"Okay, cool, there's a new position. Oh, clearly it's going to be Heidi.\" Is there anything you can share there? Any advice for people that maybe see reorgs coming and what they can do to help themselves in that pending change?"

They visualized it on whiteboards and brought people over to the whiteboards to see the future team structure that the leaders wanted and they got input into the design. We did this at Procore as well inspired by Christian and his story and we had... I think there were 80 people involved in this platform organization that was splitting from two large clusters of teams into three. And I remember when we rolled out the whiteboards from a back office where we were talking about this change for a few weeks and it was scary to roll these whiteboards out because it impacts people's day to day. It's like when somebody is suggesting that maybe you do something different or that something different happens, sometimes it can be kind of triggering. You want to know what's going on. So anyway, but we had courage together."

It's very big, lofty and whatever, but you're literally extending yourself for somebody else or yourself, self-love, right? And that's love. And when you are extending yourself, you're not nice. It's not always nice or like, it sometimes is having hard conversations. It's knowing that, oh, there's a human, they know I care about them.

One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey.

And so here we are. I want to start by talking about vision. Every product manager I've ever worked with and managed vision has always been this development area for every single one. It's always this like, \"You need to get better at crafting a vision, telling your story.\" It's also this very powerful tool. The product managers have to align teams to be more successful in the products they're building. And you have a really neat way of thinking about a framework for developing a vision and then telling the story. What are elements of a good vision for a product or even a company?"

So people say, \"Oh, I'm just a junior PM.\" Whatever level, there is some micro macro vision that you need to have. Because essentially if you got on a plane and the pilot was like, \"I don't really know where we're going, but I'm a really good pilot. The company needs to fly 400 flights this year. So I'm trying to make that happen, but trust me, we'll get there. There might be turbulence, I'm not sure.\" You probably would be thinking twice about staying on that flight, right? What happens is you get on there, it's like, \"Our destination is Miami.\" Maybe I'm dreaming of beaches, \"And it's going to be 24 degrees when we get there.\" And he always paints or she paints this image of the destination."

I want to just delineate between vision and everything else that people think vision is. So really I think there are a couple of key elements. The first one is it needs to be lofty. So it needs to be something that feels... It almost scares you in an exciting way, right? Like, oh, my God, this is something I can get up every morning. And if we did that, goddamn. But at the same time, it needs to be realistic and attainable, so it cannot feel so pie in the sky that it feels so out of reach, right? And of course, there are leaders and people who have really, really big visions and they see beyond the rest of us, but that's not most people. Most people, it needs to feel within reach.",
        "timestamp": "00:07:05",
        "text": "And then I think the key thing is it needs to kind of be in a vacuum from the limitations of today because the whole point of going to the future and saying, [inaudible 00:07:15] time traveled five years out is to say, \"Okay, I've come back to tell you what we need to fix in order to get there. Or I've come back to tell you what we need to put in place now so that we will get there, right?\" And so you have this kind of three components and if those come together and they are grounded of course, in a problem that people are excited about, you've got your vision. And how that vision manifests really depends on what you want to do. There're simple ones you can do, they're big ones you can do. But those are the core pieces in my mind."

So, I don't really care how high quality the initial MVP is because quality is defined by the customer. And if we don't know who our customer is, we literally don't know what the word quality means. So, that's where I think founders really run into trouble and everyone's like, \"Well, I'm Steve Jobs, I'm this, I have the magic taste.\" And it's like, \"Well, first of all, do you have the years and decades of failures and experience from which that taste derives?\"",

Oof, have I met people like that, and we're having a mental health crisis among founders that's not talked about enough. People have started to talk about the downside mental health risk, obviously the stress of being a founder is hard, but look what's happening to the people that are so-called successes? When you build a company and you sell it out and it becomes something that you find abhorrent, man, maybe you get rich, but it's not good.

To answer your question, no, I didn't know this was going to happen. This is so embarrassing to admit now, but just to give you a sense of how different the world is now than at the time of the financial crisis, I was so embarrassed to be blogging, that I didn't put my name on the blog. I published it anonymously because it wasn't a thing that people did and people told me it would be career suicide. And there were so few startup bloggers at that time, that the top three all reached out to me personally because they saw it in their referrer logs on their website. That's how little traffic they got, that when a new person started writing about their thing and linking to them, they were like, \"Who is this guy? What's going on?\" It was a very different time."

I didn't understand the way Silicon Valley worked at that time, I didn't understand why this was happening to me, having these meetings, and I said, \"I'll write the story down and then I'll send people the essay, and if they think it's crazy, then we don't have to have the meeting and I won't get yelled at.\" That was really as far ahead as I was thinking at that time. And then it basically took over my life, and I was being asked to speak, but people really wanted to unmask the anonymity. Who is this person?

My parents are doctors, it was just definitely part of my upbringing, and I was really into reading stuff that worked that way. So, it was very natural for me. I felt like as I had success as an entrepreneur, I wanted to know, why does this work? And people gave me advice. All the advice used to be of the form, \"Steve Jobs once did this thing, so if you do it too, you'll be like Steve Jobs.\" And it's like, well, he also wore the black turtleneck.

A lot of my work is just descriptive. It's not actually telling people what to do, it's simply giving a name and a concept to a thing that already happens. That's the funniest part. In the early wave of criticism against Lean Startup, people were very angry at the idea that I was saying that a startup is an experiment like, \"You can't treat a startup like an experiment.\" I was like, \"Well, you could treat it however you want, but it is an experiment.\" People would like, \"Well, people don't like the concept of pivot.\" This anti-pivot people, anti-MVP people every once in a while come out of the woodwork still to complain about it.",

We can't reason about it, we can't... And so this is descriptive part, and then that's the real work, honestly, is just saying what is... To me, the big question from the beginning was, what is a startup really? Why is it so different from a big company? Why are none of the best practices that I learned in my career work? It was like a survival mechanism, I want to know. And then once you've identified what it is and laid out the original principles of what you're trying to do, the prescriptive parts are just a matter of deductive logic."

They have no investors, no board. They have no plans to go public. They never want to sell their business. They've made a profit for 24 years in a row. They have over 100,000 customers and make tens of millions of dollars in profit each year, which most VC-backed companies never make a dollar of. All of this profit filters down to the founders and employees because they have no investors. Most founders, by default, will go down the venture route raising money from VCs and Angels. For many types of companies, that is necessary.

This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group.

So what's your advice to founders for when raising money makes sense?

In hindsight, not only did Google bet on the wrong thing it missed much easier opportunities. So just not far from Google's headquarters there was WhatsApp, not very famous in the US but they actually created massive impact. Hundreds of millions of people were using their stuff and they became a threat to Facebook much more than Google was.

So initially the interviewer kind of distracted them and then showed them their inbox and then the top 50 messages were sorted to the right place more or less if we got it right. And people were like, \"Wow, this is actually very cool.\" But it gave us some evidence to go and say, \"Hey, we should try and build this thing.\""

It's still massive but then it was growing like mushrooms, people were spending hours. That really freaked out Google and the obvious solution was to launch a social network of Google called Google+ and we all believe in this thing, it really caught on very well initially we all used it, we all believed in it. So our mission was to build this thing and Google really cut no costs. It created a whole new division within Google and it created a whole strategy around Google+ and we had to connect Gmail and YouTube and search to Google+ to make them more personalized in a sense and more social. So that was the idea and we went on and we launched a series of features in Gmail for a couple of years, honestly and Google+ itself became this massive project, very feature rich and with a lot of redesigns and iterations and none of it worked."

It's not for me to criticize it or to in hindsight kind of say you guys need to be better and some of the people that were behind Google+ was some of the smartest leaders and I still think they are despite this story. If you look back at the history of Google, how things started in the first decade or so. Google, was what I call an evidence guided company. So essentially it put a high premium on focusing on customers, coming up with a lot of ideas on looking at the data, looking at how these ideas actually worked out. They weren't shy about launching betas and things that were very rough and incomplete and learning from that and then they expected people to take action based on the results. So fail fast is a very famous paradigm and so you had to kill your project or pivot it seriously if it didn't work out and I think had we kept fail fast it would've really have helped Google+, if we had this mentality."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "But for some reason with Google+, Google put this playbook aside and used a different playbook which I call plan and execute essentially. But I think inside Google the DNA still existed. So inside Gmail, the next project after Google+ was the tabbed inbox. So it was kind of the reverse of Google+, it started as a very small idea that no one believed in and we started looking what's behind the city? What's the goal? What's the problem actually we're trying to solve? It turned out that a lot of people were receiving social notifications and promotions, etc, and most of them were very passive. They weren't clearing their inbox, they were just living in this world of clutter and I came up with an idea how to fix this. I was sure it was great, I wanted to push it, plan and execute, but my colleagues were like, \"Hold on, we actually tried this. We have a bunch of ideas to help people organize their inbox, they're not using it. Why is your idea good?\"",
        "timestamp": "00:10:57",
        "text": "So that sent us, kind of me and my team into researching these users into establishing a goal that was much more user-centric and then thinking of other ideas. And then we started testing them much more rigorously and basically we started testing on our own inboxes and then we recruited other dog footers, other Googlers to test the same inbox, then we put it outside for external testers. We did usability studies, we did data, we built a whole data mining team and a whole machine learning team to build the right categorization and we ended up with a solution that turned out to be very successful for a lot of these passive users. This was a surprise to a lot of people because most of my colleagues and most of the people I talk with actually know how to manage their inbox. So for them that solution makes complete nonsense, like splitting promotions and social to the side sounds like the stupidest idea. But there's about 85% of the population, 85 to 88% that absolutely love it and today Gmail has about 1.8 billion active users according to Gmail."

I actually used Ezra earlier this year unrelated to this podcast, completely on my own dime because my wife did one and loved it. And I was super curious to see if there's anything that I should be paying attention to in my body as I get older. The way it works is you book an appointment, you come in, you put on some very cool silky pajamas that they give you that you get to keep afterwards. You go into an MRI machine for 30 to 45 minutes, and then about a week later, you get this detailed report sharing what they found in your body."

Half of all men will have cancer at some point in their lives, as will one-third of women. Half of all of them will detect it late. According to the American Cancer Society, early cancer detection has an 80% survival rate compared to less than 20% for late stage cancer. The Ezra team has helped 13% of their customers identify potential cancer early and 50% of them identify other clinically significant issues such as aneurysms, disc herniations, which may be is what I have, or fatty liver disease. Ezra scans for cancer and 500 other conditions in 13 organs using a full-body MRI powered by AI and just launched the world's only 30-minute full-body scan, which is also their most affordable. Their scans are non-invasive and radiation free. And Ezra is offering listeners $150 off their first scan with code Lenny150. Book your scan at ezra.com/lenny. That's E-Z-R-A.com/lenny.",

I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda."

And that newsletter post is now the eighth most popular post on my newsletter across hundreds of posts that are ever written and even more than how Figma builds product and how Snowflake builds product and all these other incredible companies. And so, clearly, there's a lot of interest in how you operate. So I'm really excited to get into the meat of how you all work. And if anyone read this post and has any sense of just how you all operate, there's this one word that immediately comes to mind when people think of how Ramp operates and that word is velocity. So I want to start there. Can you just talk about how important velocity is to how you work and where that came from and how that actually looks day to day working at Ramp?"

My view is you start off with founder-led sales, the early team needs to know how to actually sell. Then you hire your first couple of salespeople, then you start some very low cost targeted marketing efforts. So whether it's content, community, small scale events, and then PR, after all of that is when you start paid and brand effort and then SEO probably start around the same time that you start paid marketing efforts. The reason for the progression the way I've described it is the channels get more expensive as you go farther along and they get more effective as you understand more about your customers."

The company's still very lean for the amount of growth. We're under 500 people roughly today at that scale and that's definitely have a much higher revenue per employee than some of our other competitors and others in the space. And yeah, I mean we've got a very thoughtful and smart finance team that I've worked with actually closely our old head of strategic finance at Instacart and they set ambitious goals for us on growth and I'm happy to say we've consistently beat those ambitious goals over the last 16 months or 18 months since I've joined."

Lots of really strong opinions and so you have to be able to have those debates because lots is going on, but then you have to be able to come out of those conversations with a clear kind of company point of view that you're all shooting toward.

And that was a big change that required us and others to actually rethink the entire user experience and sometimes the business model as well. And I think what we're entering now is we're going from your curation to recommendation to generation.

And they had built the desktop product already, the free streaming desktop product, and it was amazing and I could try it, but they needed someone to figure out what to do with mobile. And because I had been an entrepreneur in that space, I got that job."

        "text": "So my job was to head up mobile for Spotify and figure out what the mobile offering would be, which was a challenge because, obviously, Spotify desktop was a free on-demand streaming application and back then, specifically with edge networks, you couldn't really stream at all in real time. The performance wasn't there and also you couldn't fund that with an ads model. So it was a product and business model innovation that was a lot of fun. So that's how I started. Then after a few years, I took on all of product development for Spotify. And then a few years later, I actually took on the technology responsibility, the CTO role for Spotify as well. And recently, my official title is co-president of Spotify together with Alex Nordstrom. So we run half of the company each. I run the product and technology side and he runs for the business and content side. So that's the super fast version."

I find the plan that best suits me on features that I want to unlock or usage that I want to unlock and I buy it. However, that's not the only way to monetize that usage. You can monetize that usage with sales, too. Why? Self-serve monetization has a cap of about $10,000. That's just how much we're able to process on the credit cards before they start getting flagged and declined by the banks and how much we as a consumers and prosumers are even willing to put on our credit card because not all credit cards have limits of over 10, 20, 30, $40,000.",

You bring people, you get them to an aha moment into the habit loops, and then you able to extract value back out of them. Extraction of the value can be direct where you're actually capturing revenue from them, or it can be indirect where they're participating in your growth model via virality or user-generated content and bring additional business through the doors."

I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming. While you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on. For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming, using sticky notes, live reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, draw ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board."

Our product management team, our designers, our engineers are located across three different hubs in Europe. What that sort of leads to is a couple of practices that we have as part of our culture. The first one is practicing empathy to gain insights. It's not just practicing empathy in terms of customers and figuring out what customer pain points and problems we can solve, but given our distributed nature in terms of having a global footprint and a lot of our go to market teams, folks in sales and marketing and customer success are in different continents or geographies, we have to make sure that we actually practice that internally. When we are interacting with folks, let's say in San Francisco, and those folks are out there meeting some of our large customers and stuff, how do we, in the product organization, understand their perspective, and bring that perspective into how we design, prioritize and build products? I think that's one thing that's unique."

We used to do the show obviously on just Clubhouse and now we do the show on YouTube, wherever you can listen to our podcast. And a lot of people remember us for the Elon episode, but I will tell you this, it is often the folks who were working technology, who were not as famous, you're obviously very famous now, but who really connected with the audience.

This is crazy.\" I don't know if you've listened to the actual thing, but it was pretty cool because we got to ask him questions we've always wanted to ask on like, \"When do we get to Mars?\" it was kind of fun. And then after that, again it was this, we got a bunch of people reaching out and being like, \"You should have asked this question. You guys are not professional journalists.\" And we are like, \"No, we're not. What gave it away?\" We are just random two people who are just talking to this guy, so it was really fun."

They're all having these massive problems and they're all feeling that anxiety when they hear the question, \"How are things going?\" And just hearing other founders explain their problems, perhaps solving their problems, is a really good way for yourself to both feel motivated to do it yourself and see how problems get solved when other companies are having similar problems.

The reason I treated that was I asked everyone that I'd met after Airbnb, because I had this experience of like, this was the highlight of my career up until then, at least being in the team like that and I asked everyone, \"Have you found anything better?\" Besides maybe one or two people, I haven't heard anybody say that they found something better. And they all missed that dearly. I thought a lot about why that was the case, but I would say Airbnb did not feel like a normal job. It felt like more like a group of friends trying to just do something together and we were friends. At least in the beginning it did not feel like this was a job. It was sort of like an ongoing project and an assembly of amazing people. I think in the end we managed to build two things, like a really successful company, thanks to Joe and Nate and Brian just for starting this. Without them there would be nothing to build."

The best answer I have is probably we brought in a special type of people. We had very diverse backgrounds. A lot of us was former founders.

I think it took a long time to change that narrative. I mean, eventually you have to hire people that only had big corporation careers, but I don't remember we did that for a long time. When I actually read my goodbye note recently, my words there still means a lot to me and it means sort of like you're trying to reflect on exactly these things on like, building a great company that became successful and being part of this sort of family of really close friends."

So we would go and scrape all the official sources as they started coming out, and then validate them because they were not always correct. And eventually we had the most comprehensive database and map of locations in the entire country, including more comprehensive than the federal government and most of the states because they had really complicated limitations on what they could and couldn't publish based on some relationships they had. We didn't have those limitations.",

And we also made maps you could see on county websites, so it would help you understand what was available in your area. One of the coolest things that I've ever worked on.",

And building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sync for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, the customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences, from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SMTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like, \"Error on line 53.\" And never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product.

But one of the things I found incredibly helpful in my career that really helped me level up was one-on-one coaching.

Your ideal goal is to lead in a scalable way, which means you feel really confident about the direction of your team and your team has the autonomy to move in that direction. There's another really effective way of leading, which is selective micromanagement, which if you don't feel confident in the direction that your team is moving, the right answer is not to be hands-off and to let them go in that wrong direction. The right answer is to micromanage, but do it in a very tactical and a very temporary way so that you can help them understand what is the right direction moving forward so that you can then pull back."

And so I joined as one of the first few people on the Xbox Live team. Really focused on thinking about how does a company that's building its future on the internet think about where gaming is going.

And what I found initially is actually things felt slower when I started my own company because I didn't have as many engineers to work with. I didn't have a team built around things. We didn't have momentum around existing users to be able to research and target."

So put another way, it's like saying, what do I have to beat in order to win a deal? So in positioning work we call this competitive alternatives. Now, how people mess up this first step is, I say competitive alternatives and they think competition. So things that look exactly like me. But in B2B we kind of have two sets of competitors. We have status quo, which is whatever the company is doing to attempt to solve the problem right now, even if it's crappy and not great. And then there's, if the company does decide they're going to buy something different, they usually make a short list. So, it's whoever else lands on the short list. I need to be able to put a stake in the ground and say, I got to beat all that in order to win a deal."

And if we're not positioning well against that, we're never going to get the customer to come off of that. So I got to win against status quo, but I also have to win, most of the time, if it's B2B, you don't just buy the first thing you come across, you make a short list of alternatives and I got to win against those as well."

So the easiest way to do this is, okay, this is what I have to position against, what have I got capabilities wise that the alternatives don't have? So feature function or even capabilities of the company, which could be pricing or professional services around other things that you've got, but also capabilities of the product. What have I got that the alternatives don't have? And I can make a giant list of these things. And then I can translate that stuff into value by going down the list and saying, okay, we have this great feature, so what? Why does a customer care about it? What is the value that feature enables?"

So there's so many things that we want them to be good at and to understand that and the complexity that the role actually brings with it. That's sometimes hard for people that have never worked as a product person to really understand. So, yeah, if I would need to pick two things, then that's maybe the two biggest differences."

And I think the value for me was so awesome just to make connections with people in the industry and it felt like this is, I guess, the 2010 or something like this where a lot of Amazon people I of thought were just so 100% heads down. It was a little bit of a secretive culture, not maybe like Apple, but it was pretty private.

Companies like Netlify and Tenfold and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools, or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by [inaudible 00:03:56]. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics, and instead use your North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. And Eppo supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com, and 10x your experiment velocity."

My newsletter is the number one business newsletter on Substack, and so we're connected in this really special, weird way, and I thought it would be pretty fun to just explore this weird path that we're on doing this newsletter thing, and in that, help listeners understand the pros and cons of this life, how to go down this route, what it takes to be successful, all that stuff. But before we get into all that, I'd love for you to spend maybe a minute just giving us a little overview of your career, and how you got to where you are today doing this newsletter, and what you spend your time on now."

It was essentially a little photo sharing app for close friends and family, but there is a common thread which led us to Substack, which was prior to starting Cocoon, Alex and I had both worked at Facebook for a number of years and had worked on effectively the same problem of helping people share more with their friends and family and had all these ideas for what an idealized experience might look like.We just kept running into the wall that you run into when ultimately advertising is the business model that is powering this whole thing, and what that means is you need to accumulate a lot of time spent and attention and convert that into basically sellable eyeballs. But it's not that hard to imagine what a better solution would be. It's just that ads as the business model made it really hard to pull that off. Cocoon was in a lot of ways like a journey to explore what that might look like for this one particular use case of just helping you feel close to a handful of people."

Everybody understands now.\" It was a real moment for me. But the problem with funnels and pirate metrics and the favorites that I love to pick on are MQLs and SQLs is that nobody knows what those mean. It puts every customer in the same sort of buckets. It assumes that all customers and all products are the same. It puts businesses, or they, I should say, puts businesses at the center of the business versus putting customers at the center. It's about the values of the business, not the value to the customer that's being measured."

And then I went to a small seed funded company, help them raise rates and eventually went to Carta, which was about 300 people when I joined-ish give or take, but didn't have a marketing function at the time."

But primarily it was really about how do we, as people, communicate with each other, how do we express ourselves through creativity. As humans since the dawn of time have been painting on cave walls and dancing around the fire and writing stories and novels and singing to each other.

I mean, GitHub has more than a decade, nearly a decade and a half of history of bringing developers together to collaborate on code through repositories. But in the last few years, we've really expanded that portfolio to include so many different parts of the developer life cycle."

I actually did not really even get to see many parts of India while I grew up in India and basically just was in Mumbai the whole time. And then I moved here to the United States for graduate studies at age 21. My parents, my father was a businessman, and so, he started his own business. He manufactured spices and marketed them. So growing up, I saw him work on packaging and pricing. And when he was short on staff, I used to be packaging the spices into the little box or creating some marketing material for him, not the creative part, but the grunt work. So I grew up in that environment where the lines between what was my dad's business and our personal lives were very blurred."

And so, both of them have had a pretty significant influence in different ways, but both significant influence on who I am. When I grew up, I changed that a lot. I think when I was very young, one of my uncle is a doctor, so I saw him and I was like, \"Oh, maybe I should be a doctor.\" And at some point later, I changed that. In high school, I took French and I ended up being really good at it, surprisingly good at it, and I was very passionate about it.",

And maybe I'll teach French.\" That lasted for a few years and turned out that I ended up not pursuing that, and instead, got a degree in computer engineering. Partly, I think because in India back then, if you were good at science and mathematics, you would usually take up engineering. And so, that's what I ended up doing. I was also quite passionate about computers, so maybe that was part of it. But once I started on that path, it became much clearer what I wanted to do."

About one month in, I realized that PhD in academia wasn't for me, so I decided that I was going to drop out of the PhD program. And once I dropped out, this was like 2001, 2002 so the climate was very different, there were basically no jobs for tech people. Certainly there were no jobs for people who required a visa, which I did. So it was very difficult, but I ended up working as an engineer at a couple of startups and that started my career in tech. I was an engineer for about four or five years. And when I moved here to the San Francisco Bay Area, I got a little taste of product management."

But in terms of what I love about it, I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create OKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it. So they're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about."

And you're serving these small businesses. I always think of, not what you're working on but what problem you're solving. In many cases, I get more energy from the problem I'm solving and who I'm solving it for and I realize that I get much more energy from personally solving problems that affected a small business or basically people or small business that I can relate to. It is harder for me to get energy solving problems of big enterprise and companies."

And so I think it's important to know what kind of problems you get energy from and really think about the problem versus the customer segment. Maybe even more than the problem because I've saw different kinds of problems, but I realize that it's those kinds of customers I enjoy because you can meet them in the day to day. You can see them on the street or you read their articles. A small blogger for example, I remember I used to go to a lot of blog conferences when I was a PM for AdSense.

We used to make a hundred thousand dollars a year based on purely AdSense, and that was our living and that's how we built this other company on that.\" So big companies, you don't ever get to hear something like that. So I got energy from things like that. The other one is founder. I think, Lenny, it's very important if you think... Talking about company, is to have a founder, when you talk to them, you don't get the sense that they're in it for the money. I think it's very important for founders to really live and breathe the mission themselves in an authentic way."

I'll give you an example. I convinced someone who's going to take a very senior role, let's just say a tier two or tier three e-commerce company, to become a, not... So, basically take one step down at different company, which is at Coinbase, basically. I sat on the board of Coinbase, and I think that person still thanks me because I think they were focused too much on the title, that they were going to be the super senior person at this company on the management team, et cetera. But I said, \"Ultimately you don't realize this, but the value of working at a leader in any space, the quality of talent you work with, the brand, the network effect, so many things accrue to you.
